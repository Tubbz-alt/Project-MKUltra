           Dear
                    The Business Office tells me that it will take a few days to get a report
           on my budget througli July 1, 1965 - IBM Tnachirios and All.  I prodded them to move.,
           but business offices have time-cotistaiits all their own.  I'll send it off as soo5n
           as I can.

             Dear Sir:
                    In iay last r.aport on April 23; 1964, 1 pointed out    that a considerable
             amount of non-experiiaental work                                with the aid of

           .pharmacology is not the c-ollection-of more data or the foriiililation of new
             hypotheses, but reforniulation of older data and the development of mefhods
             by which new inforifta2tion can be readily compared and inteorated ivith the
                                                                            c@
             old.  The major prbblem is data harfdling,-not data acquisition.
                    My last report iiidicated how the trend of our research had
             modified to take taiese newer probleiins into account:  non-experiiiier@-n-"2,
             work was deferred to permit developi.iig a consistent view of the irode of
             action of --:@nesthetic agents, and a consistent view point on drug absorption,
             usin,o, !,ii.a already available.
                    1 should like to propose that these new
             follo@@,,ed and that the monies remaining in t'ti@l
            2             funds granted in my ii,!kme be used to supp-ol@--"@l-iis
                    Specifically, I propose investigations in the following areas:
                    1.  Testing the hypothesis that litimati I)Iiaymacologi,cal data of
             heterogenotis origins - and time and place of publication - can be collected
             under the direction of a pharmacolo2gist, pooled and re-an-al,yzed statistically
             to yield data cotmicasurable with those obtained by prospective., rather thin
             retrospective, expeririental design.  Case reports of drug intoxications
             and inadvertaiicieg, for example, are ptiblish4c!d frequently; ordinarily the
             pool of such reports art.@ atialyzeci only qualitatively.  We propose to5
             investigate the possibility of quantitative analysis of such data., to yield

              coherent quantita*@ive descriptions of drug s,-ndromes in Man VIxicli could not
              (conveniently, economically, ethically, or what have you) be ObL
                                                                                   tained   by
              direct experi-melntation. To the  extent  that  the  hypothesis  is  confirvied,
              a large bod2y of pharmacological information that has already been collected
              can be made available and useable.
                    2.  Using  the  descriptions  of  pharmacological  effects  In   man,
              obtained as in lki and the  results  of  prospective  experiwentation  in  huiytan
              pliarina--ology, to begin a systematic study of  the  comparative  phar-i2pacology
              of selected  drug  classes,  most  probably-those  which  affect  the  central
              nervous system,  or  the  blood-forciing  organs.  The  ultimate  pertinence  of
              animal  experimentation  to-predicting  drug  effects  in  man  depends  on
              acquiring a body of  information  about  drug  effects  in  man  that  permits
              quantitative ec)iiiparison with the  effects  obtained  in  animals.  Such  human
              pharmacological    data'as involves the effects of  large  doses  or  the  prodtic-
              tiori of "toxic effects" can  be  obtained  only  by  systematic  evaluation  of
              published data.
                    3.  Fornitilate  explicit  definitions  of  pharmacological  terms  which
              opan permit precise and uneq-,tivocal identifi:!a.ti,on of  pharmacological
              phenomena and ca-,i@ facilitate corraitunication qmoilg pharipacologists and

              itiany present uses of vordi such as "synergi-st,@' a2nd "potert,-atioii"  will
              quickly  demonstrate  the  need  for  standardizatiop  of   pharmicological

              stipend from these funds.
                    With this orientation to  the  research,  1.  estimate  that  the  remaining
              funds can b@a spent over the  course  of  two  years.  I'he  results  obtained
              will, I am sure, provide a solid basis  upon  ulliich  to  attack  other  problems
              of mutual interest, problems which have long gone unsolved because2 of
              our lack of infoitaati,oit and methods  for  systematic  study  of  comparative

              communication from you, I proceed with tlie prograift  I  have  outliried  above.
