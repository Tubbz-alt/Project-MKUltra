                        A  review  of  this  material   reveals that in the.ESP experimenta-
                   tionv certain drugs were used primarily to test whether or not the        ESP
                   capacities  were  affected  by  drigs.   The experimentation showed that the
                   ESP  capacities  were  definitely   affected by the use of drugs as follows2:
                   Using barbiturate drugs such &3 sodium anytal, the ESP fell off and.was
                   restored by the use of caffeine.
                         The experiments set out in the publications in general in no way.
                   bear upon Artichoke matters    and  are   of no particular interest except
                   as  they  pertain  to  ESP  experimentation.
