           I am enclosing herewith copies of three   tables: "Co=.L-oarison of  the
           total course of t4e LSD, mescaline and   ps,Uocin reactions, " "Mean increase
           in pu-oillary diameter over control, 11 and "Mean incr---1-2se in number T)ositive
           answers over control. " All dr-,igs were given intramuscularly, a de-arture
           fr2om our orevious practice.  The 10 subects used received all drugs.
           The methods used were those  that  have  become  standard  with  us  for
           psychotomimetic ttudies..  Tne  experiments  were  done  oartly  to  get
           equivalent dosages of LSD   and mescaline, and also to get some information
           on osilocin (delohosphorylated psilocybin).
           As expected, the effects of all three drugs were quite similar quantktatively.
           All thr@ee induce the same sort of autonomic changes including puaillary
           dilataticn, terlperature elevation, blood -oressure rise, et,,. , and all
           induce similar mental-changes including ilterations in mood,, body image,
           sensory  slk"ortion an      ucinations, chi  y o     e visu  type.     e
           chief differences relate to potency and time course.
           As i2s apoarent from the tables,, the onset of the psL' ocin reaction  is
           quite rapid, nearly ma)d.-nal effect being attained in the first half-hour.
           After 2-1/2 hours the psilocin reaction is a.Iready declining sharioly, and,
           after 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 hours has declined to negligible t)rooortions.  It is
           of some interest that psilocin is the most consistent agent we have studied,
           insofar 6as the induction of hallucinations is concerned.  All 10 men who
           received a 150-mcg/kg dose had hallucinations and 9 of them lost insight.
           Des,oite this, psilocli seems less anr)leasant than either LSD or mescaline,
           per@aps because of the short time course.

                                                                           -age -2
         The calculation of relative potency presents something of  a  problem
         because of the marked differen c-- in the time courses. Tne  relative
         slowness and long persistence of the mescaline reaction should be noted
         in this regard.  However it is aocarent that 1. 5 mcg/.kg of LSD is
         equivalent to 75 mcg@kg of psil(@@in substance and to 5000 mcg/kg  of
         mescaline hydrochloride.
         currently we are running a small study on the relative pote.,icy @f osilocin
         and psil.ocvbin.  Psilocin is of course,;nore r)otent in terms of weight,
         but pro",,ab'ly there will be vety little aLFference in terms of moles.
         Cross tolerance between mescaline and LSD is:well along2 and I  --Feel
         almost certain that a higli, grade of cross tolerance wll exist.  Ampheta.-nine
         is next on the agenda insofar as cross tolerance is concerned.
         It was very pleb@sant to s,-.e you during my last trio to 1,@,ashington, and
         I am sending kindest personal regards for the New Year.
