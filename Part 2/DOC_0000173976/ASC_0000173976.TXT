                        Drug with trade -name of "Fame Train" developed originally for
                    retarded children is now being used for rapid training of animals, esp'e-
            2        cially animals which are difficult to handle.  For example, take a
                    Macaw.  Generally, they are extremely difficult to handle without their
                    biting the handler.  Mix this drug with birdseed and in fifteen minutes
                    they can be trained for handling. Drug has retention factor of about one
                    year.
