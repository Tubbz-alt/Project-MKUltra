                A number Of the  signs and symptoms observed after
           administration of LSD --  pupillary dilatation  elevation of
           blood pressure, gooseflesh2, anxiety, sense of gastrointestinal
           oppression-, etc. -- suggest hyperactivity of the sympathetic
           (adrenergic) nervous system.  Rothitn and coworkers (1) have
           postulated that LSD has central vegeta ive (.autonomic) effects.
           Chlotpromazine partially ameliorates the' LSD-reaction (2'3 4)
           and since chlorpro.,razine is a peripheral 2(.5) and possibly a
           central (6) adrenergic blocker, one         hyp.ofheslzc that
           chlorpromazine ameliorates the LSD reaction by virtue oT'
           central adrenergic blocking effe--ts.
                Recently Elder et at. (7i and Gogerty et al. (8) have
           presented some interesfina f'lndinas in expert-,-nfa2l
           Pretreatment with chlororom@zine 'reduces  LSD-induced @yozrthern,ia

        phenoxybenzamine (dibenzyline),  an adrenergic blocker with no
        known central effects, affenuated fffeline"mania" induced by LSD.
             Since very large doses of LSD are required to 2induce
        definite behavioral changes in animals  and since the relation-
        ship of. any behavioral change induced in ani@nals to psychotic
        symptoms In humans is always doubtful, It seemed important to
        study the effect of phenoxybenzanine on the LSD psychosis in
        man.  The purpose of the present'report is to present data
        showing that pretreatment with phenoxybenza.-ni2ne did not alfer
        significantly the mental symptoms produced by LSD in human
        subjects, despite d-efinite evidence of peripheral adrenergic
        blockade.

           noted but the ot$Lier  tndicafors  of  LSD  effect,  including  the
