                 awakened and much of'the embarrassment haid-lsappe-a--r'ed.  The
                 operato r feels personally that before  this  aide.can  be  used  with
                 any measured success in obtaining information, that subtle and
                 covert means of inducing SI must be hi2ghly developed.  The operator
                 must be very adept in covert and subtle application in every case.
                      Anticipating this and feeling that suggestil-)ility could
                 be increased covertly, a recording of mass SI was offered to    those
                 observ-ing to arouse their interest and perhaps subtly induce     the
