                                     ABSTRACT
              Areas of activity during the third quarter are listed  in
              this paragraph and elaborated below.  Progress  continued
              on an accelerated level on the@basic toxicity and be-
              havioral screening programs  and additionally included
              cardiovascular pharmacodynamic testing of a group of
              compounds and iso2lation and testing of extracts of several
              oriental plant products.  A total of 53 compounds were
              received for 'screening during this time,interval.  In
              addition, a natural products chemist began work on
              Preparation of extracts of oriental plants reportedly  of
              medicinal value according to Chinese folklore.  Several of,
              these plant extracts have been tested for biological
              activity and toxicity 4in mice; work has proceeded to  the
              point of separation of several active fractions.  The visual
              discrimination apparatus has been received ft
                       and assem led. ..To date 61 per cent of the funds
              have been expended and 61 per cent of the task completed.

                PRIMARY $CREENING
                                                  36 compounds were
                During the current reporting period,
                tested in mice by the acute toxicity screen and locomotor
                activity tests.  Practically all of       pot dd showed
                                                 these com   n
                a suitable minimum safety ratio between t2he LB@ 50 and MED so
                to warrant further testing.  Five compounds showed out-
                standing safety ratios.(1000 or greater)..  These were
                                                     and             In
                addition  10 compounds showed ratios between 100 and 1000.
                However, all compounds were tested in pats At a dose (mg/k4)
                1/10 the mouse LD 250 level, for the effect on physical, neuror
                logical, and behavioral status.  Ten of these compounds
                showed significant activity.
                SECONDARY AND ADVANCED BEHAVIORAL SCREENING
                Thirty-four compounds were evaluated in hooded rats by
                the motivation and sequential response behavioral tests.
                The dosage (mg/kg) administered was 1/20 the mouse LD 501
                or lower -if overt toxic signs were e2vident in preliminary
                test  rats.  In both the motivation and the SRBA tests a
                number of compounds showed some psvdhopharmacologic
                activity, as evidenced by  an increase or decrease in start
                or run speeds or a decrease in the number of rewards and
                @an increase in the percentage of errors.  ror further eval-
                uation, test compounds were administered to monkeys, and
              3  the physical, neurological, and behavioral effects, including
                changes in shuttle order behavior in the shuttle box test,
                were determined.  This is further described in detail in
                a separate section below. Sixteen compounds were studied in
                monkeys.

               PHARKACODYNAM.IC SCREENING
               Pharmacodynamic screening was c3zried out on 18 compounds
               in anesthetized cats.  The pro-tocol. --zi thf-- pzo.---ed-ire and

               Compou2nds'were screened,for pharmacodynam4&c activity in
               cats anesthetized wi4--h CC-chlo-ralose (80 mg/kg, i.p.).
               Arterial blood pressure, heart zgte, respiratory movements,,

               carotid artery oc--lusion were measured.  Challenging drugs
               were usually administered at five-m.nute intervals or after
               arterial pressure had ret-arn,:@d to the control level.  All
               injections were made via polyei@-.-hylene cannula inserted into the
               femoral vein,
               Each compound was usua'L.!y tested in one ani.Tal.  The initial
               dose was either 0.3 or 1.@' mg/kg.  Subsequent doses were in-
               creased or decreased by one-.bal-f of a loaarithmic interval,,
               depending on whether a response was eli--ited.

                                 of the sbuttle apparatus to provide an overall  il-
                                 luminance so the monkeys could readily see the visual

               a negative regime are available for group shuttle testing.
               In addition, seven males, which can be trained on a positive

               which can be used for the visual discrimination testing
               program, are in the colony.
          b.   Seven female squirrel mon2keys were purchased and condi-
               tioned to the shuttle box apparatus.  These are used
               daily to determine a dosage-level of test compound
               (mg/kg) which produces minimal behavioral effects and
               can thus be applied in a shuttle operation.  These
               monkeys are important in the detection  of behavioral
               effects.observed in the shuttle apparatus or in the home
               cage, caused b2y varying drug dosage levels.  -The procedure
               on individuals includes the observation of many behavior

               mation about a specific drug effect which may be present.
               (1)  Observational Procedure and Criteria.  The individual.
                    is observed and subjected to the stimuli presentat2ions
                    every five minutes in the shuttle box for a 30 minute
                    control period-prior to dozing.  The first dose is
                    injected, and the animal is placed back in the shutt e
                    box and observed for one hour.  Subsequent increasing
                    dose levels proceed hourly until the maximum determined
                    dose is reached '(cumulatively).  The individual is then
                    observed in its home cage after four 2hours and after 24 hours.
                    The behavioral activities being cataloged during this
                    procedure'are:  (1) reactions to observation and.handling
                    by the investigator (flight,  attack; or passiveness);
                    (2) grasping ability (to bars and manipulanda); (3) feeding
                    behavior (eating or not); (4) reaction to blinking @ight
                    (fixation, orientation     rt resp0onse); (5) reaction
                    to mild shock (i           rk, tremor., hop, etc.);

                  (6) reaction to sound of buzzer (alert, orientation, etc;,);
                  (7) shuttle response (ability to shuttle after light
                  cue, door open,, and shock.if'used); (i) level of

                  (10) level of general activity; (11) amount of  sleep;'
                  (12) behavior during crouching (alertness, head
                  orientation responses, eye@fixation).
             (2) IpjeCtion Procedure. All injections  of  test  compounds
                  are g3.ven intravenously via a caudal vein.  The
                  total dose level is determined by extrapolation  using
                  as a base the lower limit of the 95 per cent  confidence
                  limits of the LD 50 for mice. The dose  to  monkeys  was
                  calculated using the conversion formula of Paget and

                  (mg/kg) by a factor2 (0.45).  Aliquots of this total
                  dose are then given in one hour intervals until  effects
                  are observed or the extrapolated dose level is  reached.

        Fruits of the aronia plant (malus Halliana Kochne) were
        harvested during the winter from trees located
                                       after all the leaves had fallen
        and only  brownis  red fruits remained4  The fruits were immed-
        iately frozen and stored at.-150 with dry ice in a stytofoam
        cabinet,  Frozen fruits (32.51 grams) were blended first and-
        then homo2genated with an electric blender for 10 minutes and
        extracted twice with 100 milliliters of distilled water  by
        stirring under nitrogen for two hours at room temperature.  The
        filtrates were combined and concentrated to dryness using a
        freeze-drying procedure.  The residue of the filtrate was re-

            liters with distilled water,  Each milliliter contained the
            extractable material equivalent to one gram of freshly weighed
         .fruit.  Ali4udts (40 ml/kg, 16 ml/kg, and 5 ml/kg) of these
            solutions were injected intravenously in Dublin (DUB/ICR strain)

           As shown above, at least two act       ounds were extracted
           from the aronia fruits.  The designations ltacetone-l" and
           ol'acetbne-2" indicate different steps of fractionation; the
           residue following the diethyl'ether extraction was extracted
           twi   th 200 milliliters of 100 per cent actone.  The acetone
           ice wi
           extracts were filtered and the filtrate was evaporated to dry-
           hess. The sap of the fruit is miscible in acetone, and there-
           fore it was possible to extract a polar compound in the acetone.
           The residue was taken otce completely to dryness in a desiccator
           @and then re-extkadt6d with acetone (acetone-1).  The residue
           o2f the acetone extract was freely soluble in water (acetone 2).
           One-tenth aliquotz of each of the residues from each extract
           were dissolved in 6.2 milliliters of distilled watet from which
           portions (40 ml,ikg, 16 lul/kg, or 5 ml/kg) were injected in

           as the polar fractions.  The nonpolar fractions were n-hexane,
           chloroform, diethyl ether, and acetbne-1. The water  fraction
           contained an active compound which resembles the active compound
           in the acetone-2 fraction. The results of biological  testing
           are shown it the appended computer prinout tables.  The
           acetone-2 extract is.No. 214200 and the water extract is
           No. 216006.
           At least two biologically active compounds were se-parated from
           the aronia fruits by the described procedur6s.  one is nonpolar
           and the other is a polar compound.  No difference in biological
           act,-@,,.ity was observed after the pH of the extracts was adjusted

           ethyl alcohol, or water fractions.
           The active compound in  the  acetone-2  fraction  was  purified
           further.  Four hundred sixty-nine milligrams of the acetone-2
           fraction residue was dissolved in 0.5 milliliter of distilled
           water.  The water solution was streaked onto six TLC p:@ate2s,,
           which were Brinkman precoated and had a 0.25 mn thickness of
           Silica Gel-G containing CASO 4 as  a  binder.  The  TLC  plates
           were developed at room temperature  with  an  ethanol  (96  per

         The active compounds located in the acetone-2 fraction have not
         been completely purified yet, so they have not been identified.
         This will be done in the future, as will the purification of
         the active compound which is soluble in chloroform.
         T@e arohia extracts which were.active, showed an interesting
         activity, suggestive of that produced by several typesof
         compounds, such as s2timulants, morphine-like drugs, or
         hallucinatory agents.
         GOALS FOR NEXT PERIOD
         Work will continue on all aspects of the behavioral screening
         as described in this report.  Additional compounds w-.11 be
         obta-ined-for testing.  Training of monke s in the visual
                                                 y
         task discrimination will be initiated.  Natural product.isolation
         will be continued and extracts teste1d.  Pharmacodynamic screen ng
         in anes'thetized cats will also be continued.
