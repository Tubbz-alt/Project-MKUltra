                           1.  Upo,-i rec@-,int of the al)ove-natied              it    s 3 -et ua iii
       2               the  Technical Ercnch laborator7.  Here it 'i,@,is tested      in  evcry   way
                      conceivable  to  mal.-,e  this  equipm6nt  useful  or  adaotable  to  our  needs.
                           2.  The report by                                     was   studied   and
                      conclu.-,Lons made me  aerce  that  this  equipmt-,iit  would  not  be  useful
                      unless concealed ns  r-art  of  sotae  other  te@--ting  apparatus  -and  even
                      then its value was cLiesti.on6d.
                           ?                                                     L

                      Also added is a variablf-- tape riotiitor la@, -vihich r)enrlits varying
                      the time of lal@.  This device was detertfij-ned not too essential
                      (also i-n   -@@--.2.I,report) since the 1.1,agnecord PLecorder has a  .2  secon,-i
                      delay built in.
                           l@.  The cqui,,nnent      then dismantled nnd set ui-) 'jji Ro(Dr-i 12  for'
                                           of,      for  further  study  by  his  @-roun.  He   advised
                      th,-t soinf-, time i-iould be required to corit)lete his testi.n,-, and

                           5.  Finally, it is my opinion that                         rel)ort  is  com-
                      Plete end concliasive that the  STD  eqLtiDment  adds  nothin-  to  1,,noiy,7i
