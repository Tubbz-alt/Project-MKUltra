                         The session  was opened by a slow induction in@vihich all sub-
                  jects responded favorably. However,  a  specific  post-hypnotic  for hands

                          In the opinion of the writer, the session was not too successful
                  al:though all subjects are responding more rapidly now regarding
                  going to sleep.
