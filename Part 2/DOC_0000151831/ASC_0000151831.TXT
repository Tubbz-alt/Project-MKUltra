              These experiments were carried out (a) to determine if K>2p-30>2p;>2p'

           were familiar with the effects of m>2par>2pi>2phuana>2p, LSD, and were accus>1p-

               General Conditions:  All experiments were conducted 'in a
           special ward.  Men entered the ward on the night preceding the
           test.  They were awakened at >1p'>2po a>1p.>2pm2>2p.  Drugs were given>1p.orally

            (Foster) gave a picture very similar to LSD (euphoria, silliness..

              The results warrant the statement that both the crude fungus
          and >2pK>2p->2p"02 have symp>1p'athomi>2pmetic activity and will induce psychic
          changes in man.  The data are not sufficient to characterize the
          reaction completely or to assess with any exactness the relati2ve
          potencies,  About 2>2p.5>1p->2p@>2p.0 grams of >1pK>2p-302 seems roughly equivalent
          to >1p1>1p0>1p->1p1>1p5 grams of the crude >2pmaterial>1p.
