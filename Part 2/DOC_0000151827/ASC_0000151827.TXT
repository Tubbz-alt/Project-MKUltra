                Since July 1951 a project designed  to develop a synthetic
           drug which would be as safe as codeine with respect to toxicity,
           antitussive activityp and addiction liability has been carried
           on within the llational Instittte of I!ental Health Addiction
           Research Centers U. S. Public Health Service liospital., Lexingto2n,
           Yi,entucky.  This project has been financed In large part by funds
           from the Office of Naval Research# and this description consti-
           tutes request for renewal of the project-for the period
           1 July 1958 to 30 June 1959.
                A synthetic substitute for codeine Is badly needed since
           opium, or morphine dtrived from opium$ constitute the only
           sources of codeln--. Un2less a synthetic substitute for code,-'&ne
           Is found the United States nmst continue to stocltpile opium in
           order to provide adequate supplies of codeine for both the
           civilian and n-ilitary population In theevent of war. Facillti-.3
           of the      Addiction Research Center are not sufficient to
           carry out this idorlts in addi*%,I-on to routine0 drug testing requi.-e,-!

         inary clinical data Indicated that they were nearly as effective
         as codeine for the relief of pain.  Complete data on toxicity
         and clinical use are still not available$ and morerecent reports
         Indicate that their analgesic potentialities =y not be as
         great as was originally claimed.

         developed concerning the demethylated derivatives of morphine
         an,d morphinan,  liormorphine has been shown to be an active agent
         for inducing sedation in man.  It suppresses abstinence from
         morphine completely, buts unlike morphine, abstinence following
         withdrawal after direct addiction is quite mild.  These studies
         are now being extended to Inc2lude nor'codeines 1-3-hydroxy-
         morphinan (.1-nordromoran) and l-,3-methoxy-morphinan,  Evidence
         of some activity in d-isomer3 in the methadone series has also
         been obtained.  We'hope to develop and complete studies on these
         compounds within the next 18 months.
              Need for Continuation of the Pro,ject.
              the chief need for continuation of the p9roject Is related
         to conflicting reports concerning the analgesic potency of
         dl- and d-propoxyphene.  Original clinical trials for relief of
         chronic pain were promising.  VLore recent trials against post-
         part= pain and chronic pain due to cancer have not been
