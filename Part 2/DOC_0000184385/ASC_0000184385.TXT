                                Methyl Chol@nthrene is a good initiator (high tumor incidence)
                                and a good promoter (short..latent period) -P-85 Wolf.

                      'Rethylel-,olanthrene is now recognized as probably the most potent
                  known carcinogen in the production of tumors of various types.
                       If this 2hydrocarbon can be produced in the laboratoz7 by         chemical
                  transfonnations of normal constituents of the human orrar%Lsm.,     it  is
                  possible th.,.t the substance may arise in the bod,.r  through  a  process  of
                  abnormal  metabolism  -  and  initiate  cancer.
                       The degradations of desoxycholic acid (one of the normal con-
                  stitue2nts of liuman bile), cliolic acid " cholesterol (a substance in
                  all tissues of the body) all  involve  lovi-yield  pt,-rolytic  reactions;
                  they have not been effected under anything approaching physiological
                  coiiditions; careful processing of cancerous tissues and urines has failed
                  to estab3.iqh the presence of metlWlcti6lanthrene.
         8              There is thus  no  evidence  that  this  or  other  hydrocarbon  careino-
                  gen plays &rW role in the etiology of hman cancer.

                                          present  evide  e does not exclude such a
                  possibility.  Every mimte amount of motbyleholanthrene could produce
                  a few mmli nant ce3.1s; these - by ceu-division and without.
                      Further stimulation from the initiating agent    could lead  to  a
                  p2alpable cancerous proliferation after an induction   period during
                  which the initiating agent may have been el-inmnated  from the system,"
