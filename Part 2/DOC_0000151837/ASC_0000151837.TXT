            Thanks for your letter-of 26 November 1958>1p.  I  do  not  yet  >2p1>2p,>2p,>2prow
            the January schedule, but  I  am  anticipating  t>2phat  the  Co>2pm>2pmittee
            on Drug Addiction and Narcotics will hold  its  ann>2pi>2pial  meetin>2p,>2p3  in
            >2pWashington so>2pmetime during that month. Dr.  >2p7>2p-ddy  is  co>2pr>2p->2p.>2pIng  down
            next week and I>1p.may learn at that time when the meeting is to2 be.
            I will let you
            I have >1p'receiv          of Psilocy>2pb n>2po>2p,>2p) If you  wou>2pl>2pd  like  some  of
            the material           t>2p->2p->2pm>2pe_>2p->2pI>2p(>2pnow>1p. I have now given doses  of  2  to
            3 mg>1p/70 kg to          nd am  observing  definite  effects  with  >2pdven
            these dosess >2pi>2pihich are lower than those reco>2pT>2p4>2pmended by the
            co>2pmpany>1p.  The pattern see>2pms to be very LSD-like.

            of part of a letter from Dr. Eddy.  The three compounds mentioned
            are not these of Janssen.. but are  produced  by  the  C>2piba  Company.
            Two of them, you will  >1pn>1po>1pt>1pi>1pc>1pe>2p2  are  tremendously  potent  in  monkeys
            (see figures o>2pr>2p@  physical  dependence).  I  could  probably  obtain
            small supplies of the two most potent drugs, and will ask Dr. >2p'>2p,>22p:>2p.ddy
            to obtain some for me when he is  here  next  week.  I  also  have  a
            supply of >2pEa>2p-19390>1p, and some information about its use in clinical
            trials. It is not as potent  as  morphine  in  >2pm>2pan  and,  therefore.,
            is of little interest at the moment.
            As soon as I talk to Dr. Eddy I will let you >2pk>2pnow about the
            January dates.
            With kindest personal regards,
                                           2Yours very sincerely,
