                    am enclosing      a      copy-of our quarterly       report  for your  ljiformation.-
                 You will  be     chiefly     literested  in  the material  beginning              on
                 Page  1',  17,   and   1.9.   We    ar2e    now    beginni-ag    preliminary    uork    with
                 the monoethylami8c of  lysergic a            'cid  (LAE-32).,  but probably studies
                 with  this  compound will  not  be extensive.
                 I  have had a  let,-ter  from the Sandoz company  lndicat'ing  that  they
                 will   prepare   a.g'ra..-.1   of   LSD-25  2 for   $200.00'-and   I    have    ordered    this

                 The    European     clin;.--al  literature    states    that    this    matertat    is    a
                 po-merful  sedative drug which produccs  profound effects on  the
                 autonomic nervous  system as  well.   Smith-Kline and French  has
                 already promised ine a- supply.
