                  period of time and had reabhed a levelling off stage in which it appears
                  that their interest is no longer a's strong as it had been at the start
                  of the i-iork, it was decid2ed to sliow them the various movies taken and have
                  a discussion  n the f'tlz    ccordingly, the film i%Tas shown and iiork was

                       At the conclusion of the  movies,  a str,-.ight iiiduction test was run on
                  all hands follo,@ied by simple PH  carried on by the various operators present.
               2   In view of the fact  that there were present six subjects and four operators,
                  this work was kept  quite simple and  was carried out primarily to sustain
                  interest.  No advance wort< @ras undertal<bn and the PH were of a standard
                  variety with nothing  complex  attempted.
                       The work was concluded at  9105  PM.
