                                                I.  INTRODUCTION
                     There are seven families of marine and fresh-water  fish  capable  of  deliver
                 ing appreciable voltages outside their bodies. For  example,  the  giant  electric
                 ray (Torpedo nobiliana) can electrocute a large fish with its pulses of 50 amperes
                 at 50 to 60 volts. Thouch much smaller, the African  catfish  (MalaDterurus)  pro-
     2            duces as much as 350 volts, and the electric eel  Electrophorous)  of  the  Amazon
                 and other South American rivers puts out more than 500 volts. In  contrast,  there
                 are weakly electric'fishes-which generate from a few tenths to several volts,
                 but even these species exceed the hiahest output of other  animals  which  produce
                 minute electrical currents in their nervous, muscular, and glandular tissue.
          2            "There now seems to be no doubt about the-survival value of the      peculiar
                 capability of the electric fishes. For the powerfully  electric  species  it  ser-
                 ves ob-vious offensive and defensive functions, and recent work has shown that
                 in the weakly electric ones it serves as part of a  sensory  guidance  system  for
                 navigation in murkey waters and for the detection of predators and prey.  The
                 advantag2es, in fact, are such that natural selection brought  about  the  develop-
                 ment of electric organs quite independently in almost every one of  the  families"
                 (Grundfest, 1960a, pp. 115-116). In several  cases,  different  physiological  so-
                 lutions were developed for the generation of electrical  energy  and  the  shaping
                 and timing of the electric pulses.
                      "Animal electricity" was first studied in 2 electric  fishes,  and  throughout
                 the 19th Century these animals were the center of research  on  electrophysiology.
                 As far back as 1791 Galvani suggested that there was a kinship between  the  elec-
                 tricity'of "torpedo and cognate animals" and the "animal electricity" that he be-
                 lieved he had observed in muscles and nerves.  A  dispute  arose  between  Galvani
                 and Volta wherein the latte2r thought that Galvani had demonstrated "metallicts
                 electricity by the contact of two dissimilar metallic surfaces  rather  than  ani-
                 mal electricity. This was correct in that  Galvani's  frog  nerve-muscle  prepara-
                 tions were merely more  sensiti've detectors of  electricity  than  any  instruments
                 available at that time. But "Volta was wron- in  denying  the  existance  of  ani-
                 mal electricity. In 2trying to prove his contention that  the  electric  fish  con-
                 tained some sort of generator Volta discovered  the  electrochemical  battery,  or
                 igalvanic' cell. The 'voltaic pile' of cells in series he called  'an  artifi-cial
                 electric'organ' which he thought 'victoriously demonstrated' his argument"
                 (Grundfest, 1960a, p. 117).
                       At the present time, work-on electric  fish 6 offers  some  potentially  very
                 useful leads to the solution of the problems  of  synaptic  transmission  such  as
                 the induction by tlie-nerve impulse of the chemical mechanism that  underlies  the
                 relay of the impulse from one nerve to the next and from the rlerve cell to muscle
                 or gland tissue.

                                                   Morpholoay

                     Electric organs are derived from muscle and consist of  an  array  of  cells
               called electroplaques. These component cells may be  stacked  in  columns  like  a
               roll  o'f coins along each side of the body,  running  longitu2dinally  and  parallel
               with the spinal column. The eel is an example of this  type  and  has  some  6,000
               to 7,000 electroplaqi4es in each column, with 70 columns in the  organs  on  each
               side of its body. -In the adult eel they make up about 40  percent  of  the  bulk
              -of the body. In contrast, the columns in the  electric  ray  are  arranged  verti-
               cally, i.e. at right 2angles to the spine, formina a large'compact electric organ
               in each of the animal's wings.  A third pattern is found in the African catfish,
               in which the organ is in the form of a mantle of tissue  just  below  the  skin,.
               surrounding the entire body from gills to the tail.  The bilateral electric or-
               gans of several species are shown in Figure 1.
                     Each electroplaque is a thin wafer-like cell whose two surfaces diff2er
               markedly. In most species, one surface-is innervated  directly  by  a  dense  net-
               work of nerve terminals or indirectly through one or several stalks which emerge
               from one of the electroplaque surfaces (Figures 2  and  3).  But  in  almost  all
               cases only one surface of the cells is innervated.  The opposite side has a
               number of deep folds and convolutions to increase its  total  area.  All  of  the
               electr2oplaques in one species are oriented in the same way.  In addition to the
               main organ, an accessory electric organ is present in the electric ray.  The
               electroplaques of this organ have a different  orientation,  i.e.,.they  are  in-
               nervated on their dorsal rather than their ventral surfaces.  The surface of
               the electroplaques innervated and other aspects of their  structure  in  a  number
               of electric fish are summarized 8in Table 1.

               'Figure 1.  The electric organ arrangement in various electric fishes.  The
               electric eel (a) has three organs (stippled area at top left):  large main
        2       organ, smaller organ of Sachs behind it and organ of Hunter immediately under-
               neath.  Main organ and organ of Hunter appear.in cross section below.  Arrow
               indicates direction of current flow in body of fish during electric discharge.
               In Mormyrus (b) organ is situated near tail.  Organ of MalaDterurus (e) forms
               a mantle just under skin of fish.  Electric skate (d) has organ in tail.
           8    Electric ray (e) has a kidney-shaped organ in each wing.  Cross-sectional
               view shows columns of electroplaques in organs.  The direction of the dis-
               charge (arrow) is perpendicular to the broad surface of ray.  (After Grund-

                 is found only in ray genus 'illarcint. Among  different  mormyrid  species  electro-
                 plaques are indirectly innervated via three types of stalk.  As in some other
                 fishes, uninnerval-ed membranes of electroplaques in main  organ  of  eel  are  con-

               applies to Torpedo and  main orcan of Narcine;  innervation is by individual
               nerve fibers to ventral surface of each electrodlaque entering four  different
               points of the periphery and supplying a limited area of the surface.  In 'Astro-
               Scopus and the accessory organ of Narcine innervation is on the rostral  surface,
               and nerve supply is more complicated. Fig2ure also applies to  Torpedo,  except
               that accessory organ is absent.  (c) Diagrammatic view of series and parallel.
               arrays of electroplaques in the electric eel.  A somewhat similar series-parallel-
               arrancement occurs in other electric fish in which one surface is  innervated.
               In R-ala innervation is on rostral surfaces. (d) The mormyrid electroplaques  are
               innervated on one or several stalk processes whic6h form from branches that  arise
               in the caudal surface of each electroplaque.  In some, branches penetrate through
               the electroplaque body and innell'Tiation is then ahead of the electroplaque.  In
               Malapterurus there is only a single stalk which arises from the center of  the
               caudal face of the electroplaque.  (After Crundfest, 1960b).

                              III.  NAVIGATION AND DETECTION WITH ELECTRIC FIELDS
                    The  gymnarchus has a weak electric organ which-is somewhat  like  the  power-
               ful electric organs of the electric eels and other fishes in that  it  is  derived
               from muscle tissue. 'But until recently, no one had found a  function  for  weak
               electric organs.  Now it is known that t'gymnarchus lives in a world totally
        2       alien to man: its most important sense is an electric  one,  different  from  any
               we possess't (Lissmann, 1963, p. 359).  By means of this sense, it is able to
               swim with equal facil ity  ba'ckward or forward, and to avoid  obstacles  when  they
               are encountered for'e'or aft. Its movements are made with  great  precision,  and
              'it never bumps into the walls of its tank when darting after small fish.
     2                The small electric organ of gymnarchus consists of four  thin  spindles  con-
               taining electroplaques running up each of its sides to a point  just  beyond  the
               middle of its body. The characteristics of its  electric  organ  discharge  vary
               with the individual and with temperature. For  example,  specimens  may  produce
               voltages of 3 to 7, with a discharge frequency averagin- about  300  cycles  per
                         "Durino, each discharge the tip of its tail becomes  momentarily  nega-
               second.         a
               tive with respect to the head. The electric current may thus  be  pictured  as  s
               spreading out into the surrounding water in the pattern of  lines  that  describes
               a dipole field (Figure 5). The exact configuration of  the  electric  field  depends
               on the conductivity of the water and on the distortions introduced  in  the  f2ield
               by objects with electrical conductivity different from that  of  the  water.  In
               a large volume of water containing no objects the  field  is  symmetrical.  When
               objects are present, the lines of current will converge on those  that  have  better
               conductivity and diverge from the poor conductors (Figure  6).  Such  objects  alter
               the distribution of electric potential over the surface  of  the  fish"  (Lissmann,
    2           1963, 362). If gymnarchus could perceive such changes, it would  be  able  to  de-
               tect objects in its environment.--This it is able to do  through  skin  perforations
               near its head which lead into tubes filled with  a  jelly-like  substance.  Since
               the jelly is a good conductor, it acts as a lense to focus the  lines  of  electric
               current which converge from the water into the pores and are led to electric
               sense 2organs at the base of the tubes.
                     All animals are sensitive to strong electric currents,  but  their  response
               is to currents many thousands of times stronger than those effective in gymnarchus
               and gymnotus. The latter can readily learn to locate  currents  whose  density  is
                                 5       2
               reduced to 2 x 10- VA/cm , as calculated from the response  distance  to  the  hor-
               izonta2l movement of  an electrostatic charge outside the aquarium.  Even  the  elec-
               trostatic charge of  a plastic comb elicits a response in  gymnarchus.  The  same
               fish is able to detect the weak current flow from a  horshoe-shaped  copper  wire
               when it is closed and dipped just below the surface. It  is  also  possible  for
               this fish to distinguish bptween t'geometrically identical objects  with  differing
               electrical 0conductivities. Conversely, it  cannot  distincuish  between  dissimilar
               objects which modify the current distribution in a  similar  way"  (Lissmann  and
               Ifachin, 1958, p. 454).
                 Dischar-e frequencies usually increase at higher temperatures.

               gans are diagramed. Each electric d@-scharae from organs in rear portion of  body
               makes tail negative with respect to head. Most of the electric sensory  @ores  or
               organs are in head region. Undistrubed electric field resembles a  dipole  field,
               as shown, but is more complex. The fish res0ponds to changes in  the  distribution
               of electric potential over the surface of its body. The conductivity  of  objects
               affects distribution of potential.  (After Lissmann, 1963.)

               Figure 6.  Objects in electric field of Gymnarchus distort the lines of current
               flow.  The lines diverge from a poor conductor (left) and converge toward a good
               conductor (right).  Sensory pores in the head region detect the effect and inform
               the fish about the object.  (After Liss'mann, 1963).
