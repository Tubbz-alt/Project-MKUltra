              In experiment      I   four  white subjects       received  In   rando.2-itzed orcter

              LSD from our old;,stocks.          As noted  In  the table       average       effect
              In    these    subjects     appeared to be jt:st as great,,Plth the new matertat
              at   th.-.   620-mcgn   level.as   it was at the old.
              In the second      e)-,periment     5     experienced negro          subjects.received
              60 mcgm of LSD-25-610@  ln.table 2, the results obtained are cot-npared
              with those obtalked In a previous run with 60 mcgm of our standard
              material..  It  Is again 2obvious  that the new material is as active
              as  the old.
              In  experiment 3      four-  of   the    su-bjects    received In  rarydo.'nized order
              60  mcgm   LSD-25-61   and   60   mcgm   old   LSD.   In   this    experiment    only
                                                                                  -it  is; obvious
              question.nalre      And-cilnical,gra2des       -acre used.    Again
              that the new-LSD       is   at least   as    active as the   old.
              In  each exp@-.riment    there    was of  lea-z-f cne@ lrtd-tvi-dual w-,ho  s  temecr
              to obtain more effect        from   the   new   LSD than from    the  otd,   sugge:rftng
            .:,that the new material       Is perhaps somewhat more potent2 than              the    old.
