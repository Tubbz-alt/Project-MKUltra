                    WORKED ON SUCH AN  APPARENTLY  UNRELATED  GROUP OF   AILMENTS
                    2BUT SINCE IT WAS FOUND THAT MANY OF   THE OBSERVABLE  AND
                    MEASURABLE CHANGES THAT OCCUR WHEN   AN INDIVIDUAL GOES

                    THE NAME "CLECTROSLEEPI" PROBABLY SEEMED TO THrm AS A
                    LOGICAL  CHOICE.  UNFORTUNATELY,  WHEN  AMERICAN  INVESTIGA-

                    INTEREST IN ELECTROSLEEP THERAPY BECAUSE OF THE LARGE AMOVIN

                       INTEREST STEMMED  FROM  THE DISCOVERY  OF A NEW KI.NO OF SLEEP
                       AND FROT, A NUMBER OF  INVESTIGATIONS  OF THE EFFECTS OF
                       SLEEP DEPRIVATI.ONO TMIS NEW  KIND  OF  SLEEP  IS  MOST  COMMONLY
                       CALLED REM, DREAM2 OR DEEP SLEEP BECAUSE ITS MOST SALIENT
                       FEATURES ARE RAPID EYE MOVEMENTS, DREAMING, AND EXTRE2ME
                       MUSCLE RELAXATION.  QUIET, OR SLOW-WAVE2 SLEEP IS SO NAMED
                       BECAUSE OF THE ASS ENCE OF THE OCCASIONAL BODY MOVEMENTS OF
                       REM SLEEP AND THE FACT THAT  THE  BRAIN  WAVES  HAVE  MUCH  LOWER
                       FREQUENCIES.
                                MODERN THEORIES ON SLEEP ARE    DERIVED FROM A
                       CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF RESEARCH USING    THE ADVANCED TECHNIQUES
                       OF ELECT2RONIC INSTRUMENTATION2 AND THIS RESEARCH DISCLOSES
                       THAT THE ONSET OF SLEEP IS A VERY COMPLEX INTEGRAT     ION OF
                       MANY FACTORS WHICH INVOLVE BOTH EXCITATORY AND INHISIIO Y
                       PROCESSE-S. THESE THEORIES  ARE  FAR  FROM  BEING  COMPLETE2  BUT
                       FOR THE PURPOSE OF  THIS  PAPER,  AN  ELEMENTARY  DESCRIPTION  OF
            2           PHENOMENA WHICH ARE PERTINENT TO AN EXPLANATION OF       ELECTRI-
                       CAL STIMULATION ARE,PRESENTED HERE.
                                 THE STATE OF WAKEFULNESS IS   MAINTAINED SY    TWO
                       ENTIRELY  DIFFERENT  TYPES  OF  ACTIVATORY  PROCESSES  WHICH
                       ARE  CALLED  SENSORY  STIMULATION,ANO  TONIC   FACILITATIONE
                       IN SENSORY STIMULATION,  THERE  IS  A  FLOW  OF  INFORMATION
    2                   FROM THE SENSE ORGANS WHICH ARE LOCATED BOTH PERIPHERALLY
                       AND INTERNALLY THROUGH THE THALAMIC NUCLEIS IN THE BRAINSTEM
                       TO VARIOUS REGIONS IN THE BRAIN WHICH ARE SPECIFIC TO EACH
                       TYPE OF INFORMATION*  THE FLOW IS'CONTROLLED OR MODULATED
                       BY THE SENSORY  RECEPTORS,  VARIOUS  SYNAPSES,  AND  BY  THE
                       BRAINSTEM C'O6-'iTRDL..:CENTER. THESE STIMULI  UNDER,-CERTAIN
                       CONDITIONS ALSO riAY INDUCE A REVERSE FLOW    FROM  THE  CEREBRAL
                       CORTEX  -io THE BRAINSTEM  CAUSING  FURTHER  AROUSAL  ACTIVATION.
                       THE 014SET OF SLEEP MECHANISM STARTS WIT'H  INHIBITION  I-%  THIS
                       SYSTEM.  VISUAL AND'AUDITORY STIMULI, MUSCL    E TENSION, AND

                   MOTOR ACTIVITY ALL HAVE STRONG AROUSAL ACTION  WHICH ARE
                   NORMALLY INHIBITED WHEN WE LIE DOWN AND RELAX  IN A QUI ET.,
                   DARK ROOM.  ARTIFICIAL INHIBITION OF-AUDITORY  AND VISUAL
                   STIMULATION IS MOST EFFECTIVELY  ACCOMPLISHED BY HABITUATION
                   OF SPECIFIC MONOTONOUS AUDITORY STIMULI AFTER SOME MINIMUM
                   NUMBER OF CLICKS ARE HEARD, OR BY A FLASHING LIGHT REPEATED
                   F2OR A PERIOD OF' 300 TO 500 SECONDS.  A FAR SUPERIOR V'ISUAL
                   STIMULUS, HOWEVER$ IS THE INDUCT.10N OF-VISUAL-IMAGES BY.
                   ELECTRICAL STIMULATION OF THE OPTIC SYSTEM, SINCE THE
                   FREQUENCY OF THE FLICKIR CAN SE'INCREASE 0 BY A FACTOR'
                   OF ABOUT THREE BEFORE THE FLICKER DISAPPEARS BY FUSION.
                   A sy-PRoOUCT OF THE HABITUATION OF THE AUDITORY AND VISUAL
           2        SYSTEMS IS THE DEACTIVATION OF MUSCLE TENSION INDUCING A
                   GENERAL RELAXATION4  THIS RESULT IS CONFIRMED NOT ONLY BY
                   THE OBSERVED MUSCLE FLACIDITY BUT BY THE BRAIN-WAVE
                   PATTERN AS PORTRAYED BY THE.ENCEPHALOGRAPH WHICH SHOWS
                   A CHANGE FROM THE ACTIVATORY PATTERN OF WAKEFULNESS TO
                   THE ALPHA FORM OF THE RELAXED STATF-.-  THE'SENS2ORY SYS.TEM
                   IS INACTIVE DURING SLEEP AND IF NO STIMULATION IS PRESENT
                   SLEEP WILL FOLLOW.  THIS PHENOMENON IS EXEMPLIFIED BY THF.'
                   CASE OF A SUBJECT WHO, THROUGH INJURY, LOST THE SIGHT IN
                   ONE EYE AND THE HEARING IN ONE EAR, WHO WOULD FALL ASLEEP
                   EVENTUALLY WHENEVER THE-GOOD EYE AND EAR WERE COVERED AND
                   PLUGGED RESPECTIVELY.
                         2   IN ORDER TO PREVENT UNWANTED SLEEP THE BRAIN IS
                   PROVIDED WITH A CONTINUOUS STIMULATION WHITH ORIGINATES
                   IN THE MESENCEPHALIC HEMISPHERE OF- THE.8-RAINSTEM.  THIS
                   TONIC FACILITATION WHICH KEEPS THE BRAIN AWAKE HAS A MAXI-
                   MUM INTENSITY AFTER AWAKENING AND IT IS CONTINUOUSLY SUP-
                               :-t'l@E-DAY WITH A MINIMUM MAGNITUOE@-AT BED
                   PRESSED DURING                                        -TIME*
                   THE ORIGIN OF THIS SUPPRESSION OF TONIC FACILITATION IS
                   RELATED TO THE NEED FOR RECOVERY WH'ICH PROGRESSES CURING
                   THE DAY AND TERMINA TES IN SLEEP.  THE TIME FOR RECOVERY
                   RAt4GES FROM MAGNITUDES MEASURED IN MILLISECONDS, SUCH AS

                                                                                          L
                     THE NERVES, TO  HOURS  IN  THE  CASE OF  THE  HIGHEST  LEVEL OF
                     CEREBRAL  ACTIVITY.   THIS   HIGHEST LEVEL IS FOUND TO OCCUR
                     IN LEARNING AND CONDITIONING WHICH IS THE REASON FOR THE
                     LARGE AMOUNT OF TIME SPENT    By A BABY IN SLEEP.      THIS
                     ACTIVITY IS BELIEVED TO P2RODUCE CHANGES     IN THE LARGE GLIAL.
                     CELLS AND SYNAPSES IN THIS LEVEL$ AND THESE CHANGES ARE
                     CONSIDERED TO PROGRESSIVELY SUPPRESS THE     TONIC FACILITA-
                     TION OF THE MESENCEPHALON DURING THE DAY, SO THAT WHEN
                     THE' SENSORY STIMULI ARE CUT OFF, SLEEP WILL FOLLOW.

                               IN REVIEW, IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED     THAT THREE

                      CEPHALON. HOWEVER, A  NEW  PROBLEM  EXISTS  BECAUSE  TWO
                      DIFFERENT ELECTRIC CURRENTS FLOWING IN THE SAtfE RECION
                      WILL INTERFERE WITH EACH OTHER.  THIS PROBLEM WAS SOLVED
                      SY SYNCHRONIZING THE TWO ELECTRICAL CU2ilRENTS.      THIS
                      .SYNCHRONIZATION PRODUCED AN AMAZING RESULT - THE ELECTRI-
                      CAL FLICKER WAS TWICE AS BRIGHT IF THE LOW FREQUENCY CUR-.
                      RENT THROUGH THE SRAINSTEM WAS THE  SAME  AS  THE  ALPHA
                      RHYTHM, AN-0 IF THE FLICKER CURRENT FREQUENC'Y WAS FOUR
                      TIMES THE ALPHA FREQUENCY.  THE R;rSULTS'.WERE OPTINUM WHEN
                      THE MONOTONE WAS ALSO SYN2CHRONIZED WITH THE TWO ELECTRICAL
                      STIMULI.  THE THREE SYNCHRONIZED STIMULI - AUDITORY MONO-
                      TONE@ ALPHA DRIVE, AND ELECTRICAL   FLICKER - INDUCE A STATE'
                      OF RELAXATION, A  SLEEP-LIKE STATE,  OR SLEEP.
                               CONCERN OVER LOSS OF SLEEP   BY THE ARMED FORCES
                      DURING WAR RESULTED IN NUMEROUS STUDIES ON THE EFFECTS OF
                      SLEEP DEPRIVATION SINCE IT HAD-BEEN KNO2WN FOR A LONG TIME
                      THAT SLEEP DEPRIV@NTION LEADS TO MAL-FUNCTIONI PERMANENT
                      DAMAGE, AND FINALLY DEATH; AND ALSO THAT TEMPORAR@Y SLEEP
                      LOSS- IS MADE UP BY INCREASED SLEEPING  TIME  DURING  THE
                      RECOVERY PERioo.  THE MENTAL SYMPTOMS OF SLEEP LOSS FOLLOW
                      A SLOW AND PREDICTABLE'PATTERN, AND THE CHANGES ACCELERATE
                      AS TIME PA2SSES.   SOME OF TH-E CHANGES FOLLOWING  SL'EEP
