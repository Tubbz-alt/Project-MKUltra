                   Of@b'                     a very slow relaxing technique.  This
                   attempt   a  co          successful and both subjects were placed in
                   a medium  trance state.   After, some si2mple tests for depth, both
                   subjects  were returned  to an awake state.  Both subjects had good
                   memory of all events and no attempts were made to produce amnesia.

                   subjects had an almost complete amnesia.
