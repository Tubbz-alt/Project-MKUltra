                   Lutra, the otter, is a co,-ipact, powerful, intelligent
               nik-t.al capable of negotiating land, water, and obstacles with
              great  facility. Lutra can'survive in hostile environments
              such as under ice, in hot water, in racing seas, and even
              in urban environments. Capable of  being easily trai0ned and
              becomes devoted to humans which sometimes leads to its
              destruction.  It can find its own food if necessary and can
              make long.journeys routinely. Basic cost of animal moderate
               ($75 -$150) as-'is maintenance.  Ha-------een used by man as a pet
              and in the orient for fishing....

                  There are two animals commo2nly called the 'otter' - specifically
                .the  Sea Otter ( Enhydra lutris ) and the land otter (Lutra).
                  The Sea Otter  lives. mostly at sea; is nearly extinct; and
                  differs  considerably --@=or,-, the"-land otters. For this reason our
                  discussion  will  cover Lutra, the,land otter.
                  There are many species and subsnecies  of,Lutra. Lutra lives
                  all2 over the world in various --Forms.' They may  grow as large
                  as small seals.-.In general,Lutra canadensis is  representative   of
                  most.-. otters 3.n size, physiology, habits, etc.  For this reason
                  the following dossier will  bul- infrequently refer to species
                  and subspecies of Lutra, the  River Otter.
                    Some taxonomists consider the Sea Otter to be so different
        0            from, the Land or River Ctter that it is considered to be a
                    -Sub-Familv.

                Transmorting an otter is ez-:,=a,:)-ionally difficult. Animal
                resents restricted quarl@ers and will fight and tear itself
                to des6truction to escane. Tranauilizers are partially
                effective.

                 verv otter should have a harness so that it can be better
                handled in the urban environment and so  that it can be identified
                as a pet in the country envi ronment (by hunters and others).
                .T',-.e- otter is lanky with a sLT..all head. For this reason a smecial
  2              harness must be built. Because the animal slides.a lot, a
                lbreasv-_-platel is necessary. Tne design below was worked ou 4-
                by Ma:c@vell. In only one case did he ever suspect that his animal
                became 'hung up' by his harness Nihi.le roaming the countryside.
                Note that the straps are su.Llficientlv tight allow :tome of the
                guard 2hairs to pass  over it i4n4-ch reduces the chance of it
                being caught on ob)ects.
