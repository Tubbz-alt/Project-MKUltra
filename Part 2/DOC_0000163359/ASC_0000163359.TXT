                        Backster: Sliglit correction. I would 2say whatever is abruptly killed must send out a message.
                        Amore orderly dyiiig involves some preparation for death, and we've found that where this

                        What made you think they iniglit know things nobody guessed?
                        Backster: Well, it goes back to 1966. February 2nd, to be exact. I
                        remein0er the date well because from then on a great deal about itiy

                        works -- with people and with plants?
                        Backster: Briefly, when testing people @ most polygraplis record three types of
                        changes - the breathing pattern. the heart activity, and changes in the electrical pro-
