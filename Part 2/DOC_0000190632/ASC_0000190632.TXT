                Subject:
                                                                 tion was conc@acted by
                           on.12 May 1953y SI  and li Experimenta
                             and            wi           1      volu  tee   in Room 2
                           For matter of record, it should be noted that
 2                  was'returning to work aftqr a nwrber of weeks owing to                e
                                                 second session in the work.
                   difficulties and this was her
                           Since all subjects  present knew approximately what was required
                   of them and had made good efforts on their first starts, a slow induction
                   testwas run on all the subjects as a group.  At the conclus2ion of -these
                   tests, eve-ry subject was given a code word as a Pll sugcestion and each
                   subject was quickly placed into p, deep H state by the use of the code
                   word.
                            While each subject in the second test was run individually,
                   tests for noimal movement, conversation,  opening  eyes,  etc.  were  tried
                   and in general results showed marked improvement over pr2evious attempts.
                            This session was concluded by another rapid induction in which
                   all PH  commands which had been given were erased, except a PH hand raisimg
                   test.after the count of 5 had been'reach on the awak                  e.
                   In this PH, all subjects responded very well excep-G                    who
                   at the count of"5 dropped her arms completely while             9       ects
                   responding to the Ph found their arms raised into the air    above their
                   shoulders.  This session was concluded at approximately 9:00 P14 and
                   in general it may be said the group  is  progressing  reasonably  well  for
                   tlle amount of time consumed.
