           Dear Dr. Bircher:
           Itle have just finished apreliminar-y assay of the relative
           potencies of a single dose of LSD-25o 1:,.5 mcg/kg: and of
           psilocybin., 210 mco/Rg. on 10 new huran'sub32gcls  and I
           thought you might be interested-i'n the results*
           As the enclosed table sholdsi,.there i,;ere no significant
           differences with respect to any of the measures eriploy--d
           (see previous corres-,)ondence for methods), although in 5 of
           the 7 measures, the effects of LSD-25 uere slightly stronger.
           This trend, I believe, is due *%.o 2the longer di-,ration of action
           of LSD@-25, with conseq@uent augr"entation of the differences-
           hours ,@,raluos ("areas under the curves").  Clinic-ally, there
           appears to be no real dif,erence between the peak eirfects o.,&"
           the tivo drugs in these dosageso the similarity  zxtending  even
           to the-'@.indidemce of "true" hallueina2tiors and depersonalizatl&or*
           confirgming Dr. Isbell's observations with lower doses of
           psilocy,bin.
           14e have now commenced the new cross-tolerance study, on
           9 subjects,(one dropped out), in which we will use 1.5 ricc3/1"g
           of LSD-25 and 210 -ric@/,tg of psilocybi.-i as control, test and
           challenging doses, and increase 2the period of chrdnic  into,-ui-
           cation on each of these drugs to  12  days"  Barring  unforeseen
           delays, tiie study shoi-ild be f Lnished by 'i',Iay 10, and I hope
           that shortly thereafter I will be able to send you a summary
           of the results.
           With best personal regards,,
                                          Sincerely,
                                          Abraham Wikler, 5M.D.
