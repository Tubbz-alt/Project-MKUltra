                   post.hypnotic suggestion.
                        Since the induction had been in a very slow and deliberate
                   manner, consuming from 15-20  minutes  during  each  test,  it-was
                   decided to ;onclude the evening's work.

                        confidence in her ability to  attain  a  true  SI  condition.
                                        IMJlt is  believed,  regained  a  great  deal  of
                        lost  ground during this session  and  her  three  inductions
                        appeared entirely successful.  She, herself, adnitted that
                                                            -deeper state  than  she  had
                        she had, in each case, atta9ined a
                        in many sessions previously.  Further work along this line of
                        slow deliberate induction technique appears necessary before
                        she  can be tried on more advanced experimentation
