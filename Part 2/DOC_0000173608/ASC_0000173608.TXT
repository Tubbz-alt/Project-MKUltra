              MEMORANDUM

              FROM:
              SUBJECT:    Comments on U.S. Patent 3,523,538 by.Kunio Shimizu
              The device  as detailecl in Figure Z on sheet 1 of the pate-,it appears to be a
              working system, capable of delivering a non lethal (to normal healthy subjects)
        2      shock to the victim.  However, there are practical considerations which could
              seriously degrade the device's effectiveness.
              It is questionable exactly how far the projectile would travel since any kinetic
              energy imparted the projectile would be partly expended unwinding the wire
              from the device against the friction of air and the take up motor.  The wire
              would have to be extremely light and flexible, yet strong.  This might result 2in
              excessive electrical resistance, however.  Additional energy from the projectile
              would be required to overcome the restraining  spring tension holding the needle
              protector in the safe position and to compress the clothing of the victim.
              Adequate tenacity of the projectile for proper needle insertion does not appear
              to be insured by the "spearhead- shaped projections" on the projectile's ogive.
              The spear2s might penetrate and slightly compress the clothing but will not
              insure that the needles would stay implanted in the victim.
              To circumvent the possibility that the victim is wearing an overcoat, suit coat,
              shirt and undershirt', the needles would need to be extended about 2 cm in the
              protracted position, These long needles, when used on a victim in light attire,
              would be sufficient to provide lethal penetration or put 9an eye out.
              The possibility of serious infection from contaminated needles, sk-"n or clothing
              cannot be overlooked.  Sterilizing the needles or coating them with an antiseptic
              gel,or paste would not preclude the possibility of infection.

                The bore of the pistol (Figure 1) appears to be about I- 1.,5 cm in diameter.
                Scaling the'bore diameter to the diameter of the projectile would indicate that
                the spacing of the needles could be no more than 0. 8- 1. 3 cm.  The paralyzing
                effects on the victim would not extend beyond 1 cm radius from the axis of the
                needles.  Therefore, the effective area of paralysis would 2resemble an elliptic
                paraboloid with the approximate dimensions of depth 3 cm, major axis 2. 3 cm
                and minor axis I cm.
                The "false epilepsy" referred to in the patent, probably is the result of Mr.
                himizu's limited research and confusion on the sub ect of electroshock therapy.
                s
                Needless to say electrodes must be correctly positioned on the head before
                convulsions can be produced..  His 2device cannot do this.
              -The basic resemblance of the device to a conventional pistol might cause an
                armed, nervous assailant into a defensive position, possibly injuring the person
                with the shocker gun.
                Conclusions:
                The device invented by Mr. Shimizu will not supply incapacitating energy to
                disarm or disable a man.
                Disadvantages of the device are:
                   1.  Possibility of5 bfinding, bodily harming or killing the victim.
                   2.  Limited. range due to friction, air drag and energy required to arm
                      projectile.
                   3. Incomplete incapacitation of victim due to low volume of tissue subject
                      to paralysis.
                   4. Basic resemblance to a conventional pistol.
