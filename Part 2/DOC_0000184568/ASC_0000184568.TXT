      v!Lll be a mood for additlo=IL:toe4 of both plants  In  the  near  future.  If
      still available Ws SUM85t tbat- gLn additional one to four  pounds  of  each  type
      of seed be co-ilected and forwsxded. In view  of  the  interest  developing  in
      this prolect it 9LPPBR-rs that it will b6 easier to err In  the  direction  of
      too little rather 'L'hqn too mwbv so that even  =re  than  four  pounds  would
      probably,be put to good use.
