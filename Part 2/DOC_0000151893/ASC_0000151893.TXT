                  ATTEMPTED   BLOCKING OF THE   LSD REACTICN WITH    BAS
                 These experlments were carried'    out because -'It  13
            known that BAS Is a powerful anti-serotonin      and the
           .posstblltty existed  that  the  LSD  psychosis  was  due  to
            an accen t ua t to n of th e ef f cc t s o f sero to n I n w I t h I n the

            rather than blocks   the  effects of  scrofonin In smooth muscle

                 The subjects   used were IC of   the same   15  Negro  male,
                                              -in the   experiments   dealing
            foreer drug addicts who served
            with the acute effects of BAS.      These patients received
            the2  following  drug  combtnaflons  In  a  randomized  order
            (Latin square)**  SAS placebo plus LSD placebo; BAS plus
            LSD placebo; BAS placebo plus LSD; and BAS plus LSD.
            Doses of BAS were 150 mg. ever,/ s Tx hours for four doses
            (total dose 600 mg.).     The last dose was given two hours
            before  LSD.  LSD  was  administered  orally  In  doses   ranging
            between 0.5-1.5 mcgm./kg. (aver3age of 1.1 mcgm./kg.).  The
            smaller doses were given to the  men  %-ihid  were  tested  first
            since the posslbiltty-existed that. BAS and LSD      Might
            synergize.

                   Methods.  The   methods used   Included     determination
             *f-pupillary   size,  threshold for   knee Jerk, resting
             sysfol.ic blood: pressure,@..response to a modification      of
             the Abramson-larvik questionna ire, and eva luation of the
             cttnlcal grade of the LSD reaction based on short        psychiatric
             2examinaf Tons.   These  methods and  the  means  of  statist  tcal
             analysis employed have been previously described        In   other
             reports.
                   The ee suits are  shown In the accompanying fable.  The
             only Important change noted was significant blocking of
             LSD Induced elevation in blood     pressure by the SAS.  All
             other aspects of.the reaction.      Including  mental   response.,
             were unaffected.  A number of patients withdrew from all
             experiments after these tests were completed, primarily
             because of Ion  persistence of the unpleasant SAS effects.

                   Discussion.  The-results  do  not   favor   the   hypothests
             that  LSD  psychosis  Is  due  to  potentiation  of   scrotonin
             effects within the central nirvous system.  They, however,
             do not-exclude this possibl'lify since we do not know whether
             the symptoms caused by SAS are ctue to     pe ripherat  or   to
