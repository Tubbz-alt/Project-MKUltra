                  A NEW TECHNIQUE FOR STUDYING MICROORGANISMS
              2    With differential light scattering you can learn more in minutes about
                  microbial morphology and physiology than others have learned in years.
                  Some examples are given in the accompanying Application Notes.
                  This technique - new to the study of microorganisms - shares some
                  capabilities of optical and electron microscopy.  Sample  preparation
                  is simple and rapid; submicron physical details can be studied; a wide
     2             variety of samples can be examined in many different environments
                  and states, and physical changes monitored.
                  The differential light scattering measurements detailed in the accompanying
                  Application Notes were made with our DIFFERENTIAL I photometer.  In
                  addition to determining structural parameters, such measurements ena  e
                  bacterial presence and concentration to be determined easily.  The
                2  scattering data can be analyzed rapidly, easily and quite accurately using
                  the Atlas of Light Scattering Curves described in the enclosed flyer.

             long been  an  obstacle  to  the  widespread  use  of  this
             powerful  analytical  tool.  Whil2e  some   scientists   de-
             voted  their  careers  to  the  theoretical   understanding
             of light scattering, their results were not readily  adapt-

               average  size  of  the  bacteria.  Note  that   dilution   has   not
               altered the angular  position  of  this  peak,  nor  has  it  signi-

               only a function of cell concentrations.
