                      1.  Attached is a proposal for subject project.  It wi-U be
                 noted that the forwarding letter to the Projects Revi%2T Committee
                 has the concurrence of the interested offices, although
                               "have not given it theix unqualified approval.
                      2.   This is not the solution to the interrogation Droblem
                 but is  merely the development of an additional  device  along  the
                 way.  It is straight resea2-ch and we should be predared'to accept
                 the fact that it may not result in a  useable 2 devic;.  There  are
                 other aspects to this device which have a potential in covert
                 operations.  These are not mentioned in the proposal  but  can  be
                 developed if this project is implemented,
