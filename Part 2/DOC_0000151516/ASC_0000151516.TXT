              counting the  number of positive a-4swerT (those score     d positivz.,
              after being  scored negative prior to Ingesting the drug).  The
              degree of the symptom.so recorded was ignored.  'Clinical grades"
              were assigned by mysel'f  on  the  basis  of  lntervi2elit  during  the
              test day and. flie. day fol loving.  Crtteria  for  the  grades   were
              as follows:
                   0    Absence of nervousness and     apprehension
                        Nervt)usness and apprehension without distortion In
                        shape or size of self, other persons, or tn.a.ni.-nate
                        objeci-s,

                        without halluc.inations   and with retention of insight,
                   3    Ner%,ousness  aoprehension, distortions and elementary'!
                        hallucinafions.  Tru-t-"h.311ucinations  may   be   present,
       2                 but insight apparently retained,
                   4    Same as  Grade  3.  but  true  hallucinations  present   and
                        Insight lost.  Grade 4 is apparently quite rare In riy
                        experience.
                   Tabulated data-.-how that these patlznts gave a,,i avera-c of
              98 positive respooses after three days on water and only 22 a'T-tcr
              fhre-P, days on LSD6-25.   In ternis of, clinical grade, the averages
              were-,1.95 after  three days' of -iatzr,  and  0.6  after  three  days
              of LSD-25.

              of tolerance after f.@ree days        on these s,-na  11 amounts of LSD-25.
              Tolerance     h6wever,   was   not   complete   In   5of the patients.  Two
              of the patients, FO      and   GR,   had   very   lift le response to the 75-,ncg.
              dose.- even after    three d,3ys of water., so       the presence or absence
              could  not be determined.
                    I hope to confirm these        resulfs   using pupillary, blood
              pressure s and reflex responses   in another experiment which will
              begin as soon as fhe dose-effect.experimenf which  is currently
              underway  is completed.

              art 8-day period In    amoun,fs   increasing fr.om 20 to 75 mcg.   I
              believe this parfi-.Ui@r schedule--*III  result  In complete., rather
              than Pi.rtial tolerance,       If.fhis- is true, we will theh'be  in
              pos It ion to attempt to    determine how much the dose must be elevated
              to   break   through   this   degree   of   tolerance,
