  2       treation.  The article in the "Tablet" sai
                                                      d -that it is oo=on icnowled(;e that
         political prisoners or   Soviet-occupied  countries  are   given   the   dmg   after
         being starved and deprived of water*  At first, it produces self-confidence,
         then a reaction which   includes  a  strong  headache  and  vertigo,  according   to
         the  @Lrticle.,  The-latter  effects  are  described  an  a  sense  of  uncertainty,
         a blind urge to obey-tho slightest orders and iziability to say no to saythinr
                                                                            'is    a    trade
              In this countr-,(, it was later discovered that "actedron"
         name for the drug we know as benzedrine (or amphetamine oulrate).
             Alt@ou@;h no trace of the   use of bentodrine for interrogation         purposes
         in the United States can be found, it has becn the contention of         this office
         for some  time  that  the  drug  has  strong  possibilities  for  the  extraction  of
         informatiozl  during  an  interroration,,  The  drug,  benzedrine,  administered  i2n
         surficiently large doses#  acts  an  a  stron(;  stimulant  and  makes  the  subject
         ovor-coni'idint,  undiscriminating  stnd  somewhat  lacking  in  inhibitions   (pro-
         vided the sub@-ect In allowed no physical outlet for his newly acquired anerry
         L
         o..her thnn conversition). It is during  this  period  tjiat  it  is  felt  that  a-
   2      rreitt deal of inforvration  could  be  elicited  which  ordinarily  woulci  not  be
         obtainable.
             It is further felt that   there is also another strong interrogation possi-
         bility in the  use  of  benzedrine  beside  the   "benzedrine   acceleration   period
         mentioried above.  Following the  termination  of  the  stimulation  effect   of   a
         larce done of bon2iodrine or  a  series  of  small  doses,  there  is  c,  period  of
         physical exhaustion  ond  mental  depression*  This  is  crused  by.the  P-dditionnl
         demand placed on the body by tlie drup, !%ad by  the  absence  of  safficient  fuels
         in the form of food, to support the  body  at  the  tiirh  peek  of  activity  which
         is alwvs present  when  one  in  under  the  2influence  of  the   drug   (benzedrine
         co,@nplatoly nullifies the person's appetite while under its Larluence).  During
         this state of depression,  it  is  felt  that  the  subject,,in  his  despair,  would
         break dovm and  rive  out  much  in.Cormition  which  would   otherwise   bewithheld.
            The above  mentioned possible usoa of the drup explain o,     t2ood        portion of
         tijm nnterijRl in the 'Tablet's"'article.  The lelter effects,   described        by the
         "Tablet' as ablind  urge  to  obey  the  aliahtest  orders  and  inability  to   seV no
         to anithing, cannot be explained by  o?@  of  the  physicnl  or  mental  effects  of
         either the "benzodrine acceleration" period or the following "mental depressiohn
2         period. For  this  reaboup  other  techaiques  must  be  used  in  conjunction  with the
         administering of benzedrine to produce the other mentioned conditiones
