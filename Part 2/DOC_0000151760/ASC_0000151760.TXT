           l-,'.Iethyl-d-lysergic acid butanolamide tartrate (Ui'@,iL-491, V-A-23).
               Investigation of the psychotorpimetic potency of,this
           compound (rrethyl methergine-) was undertaken because It is
           approximately 2.5 time's as po'tent as LSD in blocking serotoni-n-
           Induced contractions in the isola2ted rat's uterus and is 4--@;.
           times as potent as ,LSD in blocking the serotoniri-ir-duced edema
           in the rat.te paw (1).. It was, therefore, of interest because
           of the hypotheses  relating the LSD,psychosis to serotcnin
           blockade in the central nervous system.
                                       METFODS
               Sub,lects.  Thirteen adult, negro male former morphine addic4ts
           wi'thout signiflcant physical or mental disease volunteered for
           the experiments.   All had experienced the effects of LSD in
           previous experiments.

               Drizas. Were given In solution at 8  a.in.  with  the  patients
           fasting. In  preliminary  experiments  the  dose'of  V-A-23  was
           elevated cautiously from 0.5 mg/70 kg  to  5.0  mg/70  kg.  In  the
           final experiment all 13 subjects recei'ved 5.0 mg/7(@ kg of V-A-23.
2               Observations.    The following  observations  were  made  at
           hourly intervals twice before;,-and eight times  after  the  drug*
           pupillary diameter, s@stolic  blood  pressure,  threshold  for  the
                                 y
           kneejerk, the LSD-q@iestionnaire,, and A short mental status
           examination.  Methods  followed  were those  described  by  Isbell
           et al (2), as,were the  methods2  of analyzing tlie data (3).
                                        RESULTS
               In the  preliminary  experiments  no  psychosomimetic  effects
           were.reported or observed with doses of 0.5  to  5.0  mg/70  kg  of
           V-@.A.-@3 (8 subjects). In the final 'experi'ments, 2 of the  13
           subjects reported psychotomimetic  effects  similar  to  those  of
           LSD.  Their  symptoms  included  visual  perceptual  distortion,
           depersonalization, and optical hallucinations.  Both were,
           however, very sensitive to LSD and  both  were  regarded  as  being
           suggestible.  One was a consistent placebo reactor.  Significant
           pupillary dilatation did not occur'in either Instance.  Symptoms
           in the remaining patients were not LSD-like and included sleepi-
           ness (6 of 13), nausea (4 of 13),4-and headache (I of 13).

              -The obs&rvations are summarized in Table I and are comp red
                                                                        a
           with data obtained on 9 subjects in  another  experiment  after
           placebo and 1.0 and.1.5 mcg/kg of LSD.  Significant elevations
           in blood pressure and pupillary diamettr were observed, but the
         2  change in the pupils was small,  even  though  significant.  A
           sionificant decrease in-the threshold for  the  kneejerk  also
           occurred.
                                    DISCUSSION
               The results are somewhat puzzling in.that  the  pattern  of
           change in the objective measurements was  LSD-like,  but  was,
           @with the exception of the 2 patients mentioned above, not
           correlated with mental charges of tl2,,e LSD-type.  It seems safe
           to state that if V-A-23 is a psychotomirretic, it is  far  less
           potent than LSD.  Thus another example is added to the list of
           compounds that are potent inhibitors of peripheral actions of
           serotonin, but are  not potent psychotomimetics.

               1.  In doses of 71 mcg/kg (5-0 mg/70 k8g), 1-Methyl-d.'
           lysergic acid butanolamide tartrate did not consistently cause
           psychotomir,.etic effects, although significant elevations  of
           blood pres sure, decrease in the threshold for the kneejerk and
           dilatation of the puoils did occur.
