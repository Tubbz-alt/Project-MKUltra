           levallorphan.  Nalorphines although an effective analgesic,
           provokes disturbing mental effects which preclude its use as
           an analgesic.  Therefore an effort has been made to find
           nonaddicting compounds of the nalorphine type with fewer
           undesirable side effects.  One of these, NIH-7446, was referred
           for study.
                  Keats found that NIIi-7446 was as potent as ,morphine as
2           an analgesic In relieving postoperative pain.-but, when given
           In equivalent analgesic doses to normal subjects, was only
           half as potent as morphine In depressing respiration.9  However

                Antagonistic (Nalorphine) Characteristics.  No evidence
         of any effect was observed when 2 to 10 mg of NIH-7446 was
         administered to morphine-dependent patients.  Howevers the
         patients stated that when the dosage was Increased to 20 mg
          there might have been a slight "boost" in OpLate-lLke effects.
          There was no evidence of precipitation 2of abstin;ance by admin-
          lstration of NIH-7446 in any of the tests.
                                     Summarv
                 It is concluded from these 'Studies that the qualitative
          and quantitative effects of NIH-7446 are very similar to those
          of morphine$ and Its addlctiveness probably approaches that of
          morphine.

          2 by Wright, Brabander and Hardy. 12 The analgesic potency of
           Phenampromid equalled that of codeine In mice, and meperldine
           In rats.  Diampromid approximated the analgesic potency of
