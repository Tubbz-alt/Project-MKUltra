                                              SUMMARY
                         The African fresh water *veakly electric fish Gnathoiiemus
                         petersii has been investigated.  The study has been difec-ted
                         toward the intradermal sensory system with emphasis on
                         the electroreceptors.  Three types of electroreceptors have
                         been identified.  The autorhymic activity of2 these electrore-
                         ceptors has been recorded.  The variation of the electric
                         signal of the electric organ have been recorded for three
                         specimens of Gnathonemus petersii as a rest activity and
                         maximum signal rate when a metallic object has been placed
                         near the fish.  The number and density of different kinds of
                         electroreceptors in the dermis have been c9ounted and plotted
                         against rate chanoe and their sensitivity to a metallic object.
                         The preparation of the large tank experiments have been re-
                         ported and the newly developed instrume,litation is mentioned.

                     In our letter report of 24 July 1973 we mentioned our interest in the
              moriiiyrid electric fishes.  One of our reasons is that they have an electrical
              quantifiable behavioral variable.  The rate and amplitude of their electric
              signal changes when they are electrically stimulated or. discontinuities  ap-
              pear in their elect6romagnetic field. In our study of  their  electroreceptors
              we found some mechanoreceptors on the  chin  havinr  a  close  morphology  to
              the Lorenzini ampulla, a multisensory receptor.  This fact confirms our
              findings with respect to the Lorenzini ampulla functions  from  our  previous
              research.

                    The specimens of the electric fish Gn,,itlioneniu.,; petersii were put in
             the lucite tray, using their own aquarium water and air was provided  tlirouali
             • special glass tube.  The temperature of the water has been recorded.  After
             • few minutes acco2mmodation to their environment the electrodes correspond-
             in- to the head and tail of the fish, were connected to an amplifier, to the
             oscilloscope and to a counter.  The rest activity has been read on the counter.
             Then a carbon steel rod (diam - 3 mm) has been immersed  in  the  tray  in  the
             proximity of the fish.  The repetition rate increased sicrnificantly and a read-
             ina of the counter has been made.  Figure 2 2shows the fish in the tray.  Table
             1 shows the repetition rates of the signals. There is a ratio that could go  to
             1:23 (Fish No. 3) between the minimum and  the  maximum  rate  of  the  signal.
             Subsequent experiments could show how the  repetition  rate  and  amplitude  of
             the sicrnals are related to the size, composition and proximity of the  objects
                    The microelectrode amplifier has been  checked  for  its  fre2quency  and
             gain response using a Wavetek waVe,-,eiierator, atteiiuator and a Tektronix
             Oscilloscope type No. 555.
                     The upper trace of the photos shows the input w,,tvcform and lower
             trace shows the output waveform of the amplifier.  Both sine waves and
             square waves have been used.  Table 2 shows the waveform, amplitude, gain
             and input resistance.  Six photos we9re made for 50 ohms input resistance
             and six pliotos were made for 1 niegolim input resistance.

                   For electric receptors we found two types of mormyromasts (A and
            B) and one type of tuberous organ.  They are confined to well defined
            areas of the epidermis. The epidermis  of  these  regions  has  a  particular
            structure, which is developed in the Gymnotoides in a similar way.  Its es-
            sential components are columns of very thin, flat hexagonal cells 60 4m in
            diameter, i2nvariable in all species and body sizes.
                   The height of the columns depends on  location.,  but  increases  with
            body length. The  mormyromasts  are  not  covered  by  the  hexagonal  cells,
            but by small polyhedric cells which are arranged in a circular pattern.
                   The A-type mormyromasts possess an opening toward the surface and
            are evenly distributed with a relatively wide space between them.  The B-
            t2ype mormyroi-nasts have no opening to the surface, and are more numerous
            than the A-type and are also evenly distributed.
                   The tuberous organs lack an open connection to the surface and form
            distinct patterns (Fig. 19).  They can be classified according to the number
            of their giant sensory cells (1 to 10).  All mormyromasts and tuberous
            organs are innervated by lateral line nerves.  Only the tip of the chin w2ith
            its Lorenzini ampullae is innervated by the Nerve trigeminus.
                   Each mormyromast is enclosed by a loop of capillaries.  The common
            lateral line system has developed only along the trunk and the tail.  In the head
            only deep laying canals exist, but without sensory cells.
                   The tuberous organs  are  characterized  by  an  autorhytmic  activity
            yielding a few mV. and with a high  repetition  frequency  exceeding  1  kHz.
            The duration of the spikes are approximately 300 psec.  The transmittinr
            electric org,,tn of Gn:,ttlionemus petersii is located in the tailstalk, occupying
            2/3's of it and represents approximate i27o of the total length of the  fish.

                      The repetition rate of the impulses are influenced  by  light.  In  day-
               li-lit the rest repetition rate is between 7 and 10, in the night it  increases
                0
               to 15-20.  It will also increase considerably in the case of a stimulus affect-
               iiig the fish.
                      The EMF of the fish Nvith no load and out of  water  is  between2  7  and
               17 volts depending on the  particular  specimen.  The  internal  resistance  is
               around a few kilo-ohms.
                      The electroreceptors sensory fields of Gnathonemus petersii can be
               clearly visualized if we put the fish in a solution of 1001o buffered formaline.
               Figure 20 and 21 show the limits of these sensory fields.
                      There are between 700 and 1000 tuberous organ 2electroreceptors,
               between  800  and  1000  type  A  mormyromasts  electroreceptors  and   between
               2100 and 2300 type B mormyromasts electroreceptors in the skin of an adult
               Gnathonemus petersii.  The total number of electroreceptors varies between
               3600 and 4300.  These are distributed on the body as follonvs: between 42 to
               460/o on the hc-ad on 41 to 440/o of the electrorece2ptor fields; between 30 and 327o
               on the dorsal sides on 27 to 30'0/o of the electroreceptor fields; and  between
               22 and 260/o on the ventral sides on 25 to 327o of the electroreceptor  fields.
               The total area of the  electroreceptor  fields  may  occupy  between  2000  and
               5000 mm  2 area for fishes between 90  and  125  mm  length.  Figure  22  shows
               the different types of mormyromas2t electroreceptors of Gnathonemus petersii.
                       With the exception of the sensory receptors of the chin which are mech-
               anical displacement receptors and are connected to the CNS through the Nervus
               trigeniinus, the mormyromast electroreceptors are subserved by the lateral
               line nerves.  Figure 23 shows the main branches of the lateralis nerves
               system.  All the mormyromasts types (tuberous, A and B) are connect8ed to
               nerves forniing bundles pertaining to the lateral line  system  and  ending  in
               the brain.

                                       FOR EXPERIMENTS
                     The 12 ft. diameter, 4 ft high water tank has been prepared  for  the
               other experiments that will follow for the Phase H investigation (Fig. 26).
                     Heating the water is done with 2 x 1000 watts heaters  controlled  by
               an IIYSI" temperature controller to ±  . IOC and is normall2y held at 250 C.
               The heaters are in a separate 30 gallon tank and are connected to a relay
               switching them on and off and controlled by the temperature controller.  Two
               9 gallon per minute pumps are pumping in and out the water from the 30
               gallon tank from and into the large tank (Fig. 27).
                     Rails with nylon strings are provided for the silver -silver chloride-
               platinized-silver-chlorized electrodes 2which can be moved from one end to
               the other end of the tank (Fig. 28). The electrodes are connected to a  re-
               mote controlled differential amplifier (ampl. fact. x 4200) suspended  over
               thE@ tank and from the amplifier to the differential oscilloscope Tektronix
               type 555 (Figs. 29, 30 and 31).
                     An electric fish can be suspended in one of the  restraining  devices
               shown 2in Fig. 32.  The fish restraining devices are provided with stainless
               steelend electrodes which are connected to ,in audio-amplifier (ampl. fact.
                300) and to the oscilloscope and displayed on a second beam.
                      Our preliminary experiments show good promise for recording the
               ch,,inges in the field of electric fishes produced by them as a result of stimuli
               they are presented with.
