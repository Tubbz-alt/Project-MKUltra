             As you undoubtedly knoi, I had a visit week         before last   from
             Mr. Kornelsky.    We went   over  the d.ata obtained so far, and      are
             In the process   of,.making duplicates of the graphs  In the dose-
             e f f ect exper imen f
             Since Mr. Kornetsky has been here, we have completed another
            2 tolerance  expe'ripent.  In   this   experiment   pafients.-were   given   LSD
             for eight days  i@ doses  increasi,ng from 20 mcg. to 75 mcg. oice
             dall%, at 9 a.m. 0-i  the,n'lnth  d-ay,  the  75-,-ncg.  dose  w-is  reocated.
             The results aopear in Table 1.  J'N-- expected,. a conside2rable d-gree
             of tolerance was develo'ed to the subjective effects of L5D-25.

             after  thrce days of weter.   In scoring e- number of positive answers
             and clinical-cirades, the same criteria were used as described in
             my prior letter.  The grade of tolerance, however, taking into
             account the individuals concerned, does not appear to be any areater
             than that developzd after three day2a on f-,vo small doses daily
             (see prior   report).  Moreover,   patients   on   the   eight-day   sci%edule
             reported  more  side  effects  as   toler,ance   was   developing,.nore   par-
