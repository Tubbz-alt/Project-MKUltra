                   Bacl,.rround:
                       ilcr-frer and some other psycholoi; ists have argued that there are two
                   distinct.methods  of  conditioning  or  learning   (roughly#   classical 2  con-
                   ditioning  and  instrumental  learning).   Furthermore   they   have   insisted
                   that  instrumental  learning  cannot  be  reduced  to  classical   conditioniz3g"
                   and that classical conditioning  ca=o***  be  explained  by  the  laws  0&'
                   instrlmental  learning.  As  evidencej,  Yowrer  points  to  the  f2act   that
                   autonomic responses and skeletal responses are qualitatively different
                   as  t7ney  are  given  in  nature.  "Here.we  are  ass=ing  that   behavioral
                   responses are categorica-Ily ditfferent from e=tional responses:  the
                   former are 'voluntary' &rA s-i@oject to 4@nf;:.aelice tJaroua@2  reward.and
                   punishment (and not conditionablej, 3trictly speald.-ig)o whereas  the
                   latter are involuntary and conditioaa7ole and not a-@ioject to  control
                                                                            ame way  as  are

                       Tiaere are everyday "I&n3-,.ances c@' apparen,,'.,learr4rAa of an autonomic

                   reinforcement. however., it is  not  ,)ossib"@c  to  rul8e  out  the  effect  of
                   skelet"l mediat-'-ng responses in any  of  these  cases.  If  the  autonomic
                   response in questioa is clicired uy  c-n  une7aservcd  skcletal  responsc,  it

                   is possible  that  all  of  the  evidence  for  apparent  autonomic  learnine
                   merely reflects the parusitic reinforcement of the undcrlyim skeletal
                   response.
                       Some authors (Kandiers 1962) have insisted that even the posalbility
                   of skeletal mediators is sufficient to reject the li@-potnesis of rutoncmic
                   learni2ng through direct reinforcemento'
                       7'he mediation explanation asserts that the mediator is      a   skeletal
                   response which precedes and elicits the autonomic response.  t..s a rea:ult
                   of rewarding the autonomic response, the skeletal response is parasitically
                   reinforced  and  learned.  Thus  it  is  i=lied  that  a  typical  neg&tively
                   accelera2ted learning curve vauld develop for the skeletal response.  I4.
                   is also implied that ttle variabili-k,,r in the  autonorac  response  can  be
                   4"uUy exdlained by the changes in the frequency of the underlyizlg skeletal
                   response.
                       In the present experiment,, it i3 proposed to    set up an e.%-plicit medi-
               2    ating skeletal response which elici@s a drop ir. galv='Lc skin resistance#
                   and then reinforce the e2leited --utcr..=ic response.
                       If the mediation explanation in  carre.-t.,  it  should  be  Possible  to
                   discover both the negatively accelerated curve'.of the skeletal response
                   and to expl2ain  the  variability  of  the  elicited  autonomic  response.  It
                   may also be posr.-I-ble to compere these find.1r@gs with the results o-@O the
                   earlier studies Viere an auton=;-c response was apporen4,.ly dire--tly
                   reinforced. If the learning  curves  are  verv  similaro.  It  vo3uld  sugge3t
                   that an unknown skeletal m--diator wai responsible for the chaziees
                   observed in the earlier work.

                        It is possible that results fr= this study will give us some kind
                    of model of operant learning of auton=ic responses as it occurs in
                    stressful situations*
                    Method:
                        The method will be a fairly  direct extension of methodology used in
                    earlier studies                    CoU2eZe a,;.-,e female volunteers wl-11 be
                    used; this will permit a reasonable compari&on with tte.old data.  Ten
                    experimental and 10 control subjects will be nm,, they will be matched
                    for frequency of GSR nonepecific defle--tions on the first day o-.P the
                    ekueriment and yoked for schedules of  reinfor2cment  for  the  remainder  of
                    the experiner,%.
                      'In the earlier studies it was observed ttat very larf:e respirations

                    rate. Ttiese large respirations were often followed by a GSR  deflec4h-lion.

                    emitted 0 to 26 gross irrerularities of respirations during the twenty

                    often elicited GSH deflections. - 7i@.e rate of GER elicitation varied  from

                    it is suggested that the responses be =nitored by the experimenter
                 at this point.  It would probably be too cpaplicated to set up an
                 automatic reinforcer for what should be a relatively  short,,  contained
                 study.

                 will be given'2 days of adaptation, five days of rei nforcement (contingent
                 or yoked) and three dktps of eytinction. We will follow the polic,.%, of
                 having the subjects sit quietly for twenty-five minutes before each day's
                 session of twenty ninuter,.  All gii-18 will be screened for medical
                 problems and run in between men2strual periods. The  ey-periment  shcrild

                  relatively greater increase than the experimental subjects.
                      alhere are side individual differences in basal resistance.  In my
                  1964 study., I found that it varied from 61.9 K (Wil day 1) to 444.6 K
                  (14HP ftY 5) -
                      Within an individual,, a ma-.cimuru change of aboat 150-200  K could be
  2                seen from day one of the experiment to dRy ten.  I-led-'Lan readings for
                  eacli day were' used as estimates of each subject's daily level.

                      In the, 1964 study,, experimentals maintained their initial level  of
                  heart rate while controls showed a a-n" but consistent decline.
                      A,gain,p there are fairly large individual differences. In  the  1964
                  study,, the eighteen subjects ranged ftcn 61.8 to 104-7 with  a  gtandard
