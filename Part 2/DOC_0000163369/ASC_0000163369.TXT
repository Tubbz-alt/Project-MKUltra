                                        INTRODUCTION
                  Chlordiazepoxide ahdIW1900 were employed to explore the
                  usefulness of a test based on  the grooming behavior of albino
             2     mice, according to the method  of  0  Rohte, (Brit. J. Pharmac.
                  34:236, 1968) for the  detection  of sedative agents.  Rchte
                  states that the main advantage of  this test is that  it reduces
                                         s     weak sedatives by providing a
                  the difficulties in te tinq
                  releaser   mechanism to the instinctive grooming movements of
                  whi2te  mice.   Rohte found that administration of certain test
                  substances was associated with a significant inhibition of
                  grooming   movements compared with control group

                 The "grooming  un"It" appears to accurately measure grooming     activitv
                 during the first   few hours of test. At    later i
                                                                     nterval,s   grooming

                 to note additional grooming    activity
                 light.  Therefore, the decreased rate     of grooming toward the
                 sixth hour in"all groups except the controls (see Figure 10) may-
                 be  due  to the inability to  measure grooming rather than an
                 ac2tual decrease caused by    the drug.
                 For  purposes  of  statistical  analysis  each  subject  was   assigned
                 a grooming index at each hourly observation (see      Table   1).   The
                 grooming  index was obtained by  summing  the  grey  values  (light  -  li
                 medium =  2, dark    3) for the six body areas a-f.  Each dose
                 group   was compared with the controls  in  a  Wilcoxon  two  sample  test
                 (Laurence  and Bacharach, p.  80)  (see  Table  2).  The  test  was  not
                 applied to the on6-hour data because of the large number of ties.
                 For Chlotdiazepoxide  the grooming indices of the 125 and 63         mg/kg
                 dose groups  were found to be significantly     decreased  as   compared
                 to controls  throughout the 6-hour period.      The 232 mg/kg group
                 showed a significant decrease in grooming      at 2nd and 6th hour.
                 The grooming of the 3.2 mg/kg group was found to be significantly
                 decreased as compared to  controls  from  the  3td  to  the  6th  hour.
                 No difference in grooming was found with the 0.32 mg/kg group.
                 For         0,  0.1 mg/k3g was.a  no  effect  level.  Mice  which  received
                        00 at 1.0 mg/kg showed a significant decrease (P         ;05)  at
                 the 1-3 hour   intervals and very significant    decrease (P      0.01)
                 at the 4-6 hour  intervals,  when  a  one  tailed  test  is  considered.
