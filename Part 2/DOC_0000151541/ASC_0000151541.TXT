              repor..s from other laboratories that large doses of Frenqu,,,[
              would amel-io"rafe the LSD reaction, and (2) because the comoany
              claimed th2at in our original blocking experiment f@e degre'e of
              mental effect was not sufficient for the effects of Fr,-nquel to
              be evident.  As you see from the data in the letter, this
              reversal experiment was a complete failure.    @qe we re u n,3b[. f
