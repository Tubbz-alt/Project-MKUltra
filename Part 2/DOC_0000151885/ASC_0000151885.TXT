         Preliminar,/ Descrieflon Of The Reaction
              Definition.  Intoxication with C-9 refers    to the sum   tol'al
         of mental and physical changes induced by    Ingestion of this drug
         and Is characterized by slow onset after oral    Ingestion, prolonged
         persistence of  symptoms,  conjunctival  injection,  pseudo2pfosis,
         tachycardia at rest, postural fachycardia and    hypofension,  and
         subjective symptoms which occur Include drowsiness mixed with
         a ppr-e
              -hens-ion, dryness of the mouth, difficulty in  thinking  and
         concentrating'  variable changes In moods and a feeling of increased
         sensory perception.
                ys ical Pr
              Ph         ooer ies. C-9 is  2an  oily  resin.  It  is  soluble
         in organic solvents including ethyl alcohol, but is Insoluble in
         water. Alcoholic solutions of the drug  are  stable  for  at  least
         8 ironfhs*
              Method of Administration.  Because of the drugs insol:ubilify
         In water, methods of administration are limited.  The drug is
         ef f e.c t. I. ve orally an-d may be given in food., coffee2, soft  dri:nks,
         or aico,@olic@ drinks. It Is also            when dria-,-4 e-% -N
         and smoked, although the effects are  generally  milder  and  less
         consistent after smoking as compared with oral'ingesf'ion.
              Dosac    The p
                  IC         resent descripf ion is based on doses  (tofa.1  of
         0.5 to 2.5 mg. of the drug orally.  Def-inite cardiovascular et'fects
         can be defected in doses of 0.5 mg.  Definite subjective effect's

         are reported with dozes of I mg. or more&  At I mg. level, the
         ef fect s are us ua Ily regarded as pleasant by experienced marihuana
         users*  With the higher doses, subjective effec s become    S-
         agreeable even to experienced addlci's..  With doses of 2 mg. or
         more., tardlovaicular effects become very prominent and fain,'Ing
         -may occur on standing.
             Time Cours2e. Following  oral  ingestion  both  cardiovascular
         and subjective effects appear about one and one-half to two hours
         after a@ministration of the drug.  Maxt mum effect Is reached
         four or five hours after the drug Is given.  The peak effects is
         maintained to about the 16th hour following administration of the
         drug.  Some effects may persist as long as  24 to 48 hours  after
         administration. In ge2neral, the larger the dose of  C-9  that  Is
         given the longer symptoms persist.
              Subjective Sy-,lpfoms.  During the height of the C-9 reaction
         (4.-16 hours) the following symptoms, which are listed by orgarv
         systems, have been reported.  The list does not Include all
         symptoms that have been ment.loned but only those that are

             General  Characteristics   of   C-9   Reaction.   Although   the
      @mental e@fects Induced by C-9 seems somewhat vague, they are
        -deftnitety marihuana-like and are so identified by experienced
        tublects  who  are  well  acquainted  with  the  effects   of   marihuana.
        Suc2h  patients  state  that  the  chief  differences  are   slow   onset

        to  Induce  a  mental  state  characterized  by  a  peculiar  mixture   of
        pleasant sedation plus apprehension and anxiety which has no

        frequently re2ported.  Distortion of ti'me sense Is often         men.'Ioned.;

        present.  This  is  usually  described  as   consisting   of   slight

               SyTptoms Induced by C-9 differs sharply In overall pattern
         from those induced by LSD-25.  In the LSD reaction, nervousness,

          are.also Induced by the members of the marihuana group (marihuana
          Itself and parahcxyl compounds).    They cons2ist essentially of
          fachycardia and postural hypotenst@n.  These effects are evident
          In two-@hours. and may be present  24 to 48 hours  la-ter.  They  may
          be present for 24 to 48 hours- after   the  ingestion of doses  of  2

               Variations.  As is the case with all drugs,, the degree of
          effect obtained with a given  dose  of  C-9  varies  from  Individual
