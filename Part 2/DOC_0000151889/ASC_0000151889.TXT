                  have tested the new lot of material an 3 men using
                            to I .5 A ./2kg. of body we Ight- .  Typical

                 observed in the same patient s dur Ing, a pre ced tng
                 week, using a lot of o I der mate r I a I    fherefore,
                 foal that the new  mat'erlal is biologically active as
                 the old, and that any further testing of if Is
                 unnecessary.   If you wish more ex2tens lve -testing
                 please let me know.
                 I am enclosing a table showing resul@s obtained      when
                 2-4 mg./70 kg. of BL)L-148 were administered si..-nuitaneoLs ly
                 with .5-1 .5 mcg./kg. of LSD.    There is, obvious ty, no
                 statistical difference In any of the measurements.
                 I have ob2toined a copy of Nature containing the paper
                 by Ginzel and Mayer-t'-7ross- in which blockingl of LSD-25
                 by 6(;-L was reported.  This apparently occurred only
                 when BCL.was given for @t least f%-.,o days prior to LSD.

       2          like tolerance than it does like eompetitive blocking.
