                   depth2lof hypnotic control had been    obtained in  each  of  their  cases.
                       The first test consisted of a     very  slow  methodical  routine  re-
                   laxingtechnique in which every effort  was  made  1-y  the  writer  tTo
                   place both subjects in a3  deep  a  trance  state  as  possible.  I'his
                   test was continued for arout 15 minutes.     'nien  the  subjects,  before
           2          k!@uipg., wer      n the post hypnotic suggestion that if either

                                   the writer touched  the  knot  of  their  tie,  they  would
                   immediately, after awakening,  return  into  a  de%ep  trance  state.
                   Both subjects apparently attained, in  this  test,  a  deel)  sleep  state
                   appearing very relaxed as  far  as  body  posture  and  facial 2 expression
                   were concerned.  They  were  awakened  by  the  standard  123h5  method
                   and shortly thereafter  in  a  general  conversation,  the  writer  tested
                   the post hypnotic by touching the knot of his tie.  Both subjects
                   responded to this  suggestion  and  immediately  dropped  into  a  deep
                   sleep state.  They  were  awakened  from  thi2s  and  a  briefgeneral
                   discussion followed.
                        The next experiment attempted was    b                 .10 ag in

                   placed both subjects in apparently a dee
                   simple conversation while in a sleep afate,     lioth subjects   were
                   told to open their eyes  and  maintain  a  normal  appear2ance  and   carry
                   out certain walking and other type movements in the Operations Room.
                       ,U@.iects followed these instructions perfectly.  Thereafter,
                                returned them into a,_,ilegp,-,stiLte. At this  point  and

                   would be stuck to the floor where they were then sitting.

                      jects that their-@arms were                       lild be insen3ible to,
                      feelings in their arms or hands.                       hen  tested   this   by
                      pinching both subjects' ha2nds an  by tapp        ng  n both hands with
                      hi5 fingers.  When questioned concerning thts, both subjects stated
                      that they were unable to feel pain or any touch sensat'
                      hands or arms.  Since this was still not conclusive pro
                      asked the subjects to extend theirhands out in a typica
                      catalepsy.  Thereafter,  he  told  the  subjects  that  he   had   a   needle,
                     2 which he had, and he was going to prick their liands to determine
                      whether or not they were able to feel anything.
                      proceded to prick both subjects'       hands on ttie ba              palm    a
                      number  of  times  and  with  force  and  neither  subject  showed   any   re-
                      action to the prick of the needle at any given time either by
                      arm movement, facial movement, eye movement, body2 movement, or
                      sound.  At the conclusion of this test                        L-stored    full

                      method.
                            In the very considerate opinion of                     and the writer,
                      both  subjects  were  without  qu2estion  in  a  eep  tran   e   state   during
                      this  test  and  it  is  believed   absolutely   physically   impossible   for
                      the subjects, had they not been in a trance state, to have maintained
                      their arms and hands and facial expressions, etc. when pricked with
                      :.4 needle, particularly with their eyes closed.
                            While  this test indicated that the subjects could, upon oc2-
                      casion, reach a deeptrance state, further tests were continued.
                      The    writer placed both subjects again in a deep sleep state And
                      attempted ag;in, by using the 1 to 10 counting inethod, to pro-
                      duce a very deep sleep state in both 3ilbjects.  Tllerea-fter, the
                      writer  attempted  to  create  the  liallucinition  that  ni2usic   was   being
                      played in the room, buth neither subject was ablf- to "he,.ir" the
                      music.  -The  writer  then  took  a  half  glass  of  water  anci   identified
                      it as perfume and asked each subject to sniell it and                whp-ther
                      or not they tliought the perfume was pleasant.                         identi.-
