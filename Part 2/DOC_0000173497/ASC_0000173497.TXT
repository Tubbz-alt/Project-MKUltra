                   1. The basic research concept is-well planned;  however,  the  following  sug-
              gestions come to mind:
                       a.  I do not recorarend the exclusive use of dogs--actually 1,100 in
              number.  During the pos2t 5 years, there has been considerable research on electro-
              anesthesia in the U.S. with animals of all kinds. In spite of  this.  effort,  lit-
              tle is applicable to electro-anesthesia in the human.
                       b. Preliminary investigations might well begin with  the  do-  in  order
              to develop technics peculiar to inducin- electrc-aneathesia  and  in  monitoring

              the condition of the animal during and after passage of electrical currents*
                       c.  Pollowin- the use of a reasonable number of dogs--perhaps 100--the
                                   0
              research should be directed to the rhesue monicay,where the subject can  be  used
              repeatedly day after day.
                       d. As soon as expedient, the observations should  be  transferred  to  a
 2             few chimpanzees, which, like monkeys, can be used repeatedly, varying the
              electrode placement and nature of the electric currents 'With  continuous  monitor-
