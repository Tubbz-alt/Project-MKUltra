                           Subject:   SI and li Experimentation (24 Septeriber 1951)
                                 On'24 September 1951 in Puilding 13, R
                                                                                    oom 20 1                  Ind_
                           the writer engaged in SI experimentation with
                                  An  SI state was itid2uced in                         and  while under        she
                           complained  that  it  was  chilly   in   t   e   room.   n  attempt   was    made    to
                       @ereate      the hallucination that it was becoming very warm in the room.
                           This   attemdt   failed   partially   in   that   the    subject    was    induced.to
                           wipe perspiration from her forehead on several occasioris.   However,-
 2                          when aske                    mate    analysis,    regarding    the    temperature    of
                           ti
                           ie room                       till mentioned that she was not-,@4arm enough.
                           IN order to   pro          his subject to the degree of unrestrained
                           normal movement and speech under SI condition, the subject was told
                           to  sit,  open   her   ey2es, and go get her coat.         The     subject     coinplied
                           with these-directions.   The subject's movements were ct)nipletely
                           nomal   in   all    respects with   the   excer@tion   that   they   were   a    trifle
                           slower    than    ordinarily would    be     expected.
                                   A   post   hyunotic   suggestion   was   given   to    the    subject    th2at
                           ach and every tim(-,     ttie writer touched the knot of h@Ls tie, the
                           e
                           subject would immediately go into a deep sleep.   This post hypnotic
                           Was attempted with complete success several't:imes.   Each and every
                           time the subject'going into a deep SI state.
                                     To test   for   hallucinations,   the  2  subject    was    iiistructed    on
                           tw-o different     occasions      that
                                                                 (1) her right foot would be stuck
                           to the  floor  and  she  would  be   unable   to   move   it   and   (2)   that   she
                           '-would  be  unable  to   draw   her   hands   from   her   coat   pockets.   Both   of
                           these   hallucinations   we2re   very   successful   in    that    the    subject    was
                           completely   unable   to   move   her   foot   or   withdraw   her   hands   from   her

                                          t  pt     was made to   induce   an   SI   state   in   the    subject
                           with her   eyes.completely open.   This         attempt4-,'   proved   only p-artially
