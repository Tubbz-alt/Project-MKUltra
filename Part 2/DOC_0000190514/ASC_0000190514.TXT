                      Deputy Chief,     I & 8 Staff                                            27 October     1950
                      T)iore are a    few  nnswera to     certain questions which viore brought up at,
                the conference whicho      because of     the timo limi-botioneg  I       was   unable    to    discuss
                at the time,,
                      I   am   more  2 convinced   tlinn   ever   concerning   the   necessiiy   of    the    preventing
                or  the   dianom:lmation   of   knowledge   that   re   are   using   a   hypnotic   toohniqiiso,   Be-
                cause of this, it mooris inridviaable to rely upon the-oral technique of drug
                administration*, Although this method mF.7 2well succeed in a large portion of
                Cases,, 'in  those  in  rhioh  it   fails#   the   subjects   would   have   reason   to   Icio%T   that
                hypnotic attempts had been tried and miglit well priss dn such information to other
                people.    In   our   recent   research   project,   no   word   or   mpnipulation   which    could    be
                construod   by   tl2io   individuals   affected    ex    the    commonly    recognized    hypnotic    toohnique.
                       Tlio   sam   general   objeotionn   would   bo   applicable   -to    the    surreptitious    use

           2     technique might be recognized by tlio subject,               As   you   knows   since    time    imnemorial,,
                &t-tompts have boon made to ext-relei, information           from    Individuals    under     the     influence
                of L,.Icohol,, sometimes with success,, often with           failure.    As    a    matter 2   ofacto    other
                drugs  used  to  affect  tlio  stskte  of   consciousness   axe   not   much   tiiffereii-L-   in   their
                effects  than  tllrtt  of  nloohol*  It   in   probable   tliai-,   the   Lntrnvonous   uot3   of   solu-
                tions of alcohol might be just as e.Cficacious as tha2t- of any uf tlio preparations
                we  are  now  ucinc*  In  P,  coi.-il)arison  between  -"-,he  effects  of  alooliol   and   the   otlier
                drugs.  it must be remembered that          L-here   is   a   wide   dif.Corenoo   in    individual    response

                In  the  moantimes   my   genoroll   feeling   is   that   because   we   have   accompl:Loliod   tliinge
                which seem almost impossible,, the          authorities concorliod almost          believe   i-I   t    nothing
