                  the f ils,       s were not as effective as it was desited, two
                  sequences were-ru"n' off during the night's work using new lights
                  and camera arrangementsk  A third sequence was run  developing an@-,
                  other theme which, if successful, will certainly be more effective
                  than an earlier presentati8on that we had made.
                       The film work consumed the entire time and no purely experi-
                  mental work was accomplished.
