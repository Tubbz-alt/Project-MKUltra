                       Dear Dr. Isbell:
                           I am forwa-ding under 2sefarate cove- a 20 gm. sample of
                       material that would appear to be of great interest to you.  This
                       compound is- reputed to be a very potent antago,-.ist of barbitur-
                       ates.  The p'.harmacologist who has been studying its action cl"ims
                       that it is "Infinitely su,,,)eriorl@io megimine".  lie.also sta46es tlizlt 2"it
                       is not a convu-Isant material, it has very loiv to---icity and tnat it acts
                       by displacing t,ie barbiturate from the site of action ratlier ti.,L,-in by
                       gancral sttmulation'@'.
                           I bav- more oO ths material on iiaad and it is quite readily ob-
                       tainab"Le., "I -,v,&.Il be able to furnisli more precase infor 'mat4.on later but
                       at present the above info-rna,6-'jon and the fact that the LD50 in the
                       rat is orreater than 300 m /kg. is all tl-.-at 'L can tell you.

                           ,.t occurred to ,-ne that if thi's rnateriil turns out to be as aJ
               2        vertised for the barbiturates, it mi--=@,:it be  '%.-o 1'ry iy'. versus
