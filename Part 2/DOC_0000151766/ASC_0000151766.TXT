                     To develop adequate synthetic substitutes for codeine,
                the oplat'.e which Is  most  widely  used  in   medical   practice-,
                and for iihich there   Is no domestic natural source-of supply.
                     The niost satisfactory analgesic substitutes for code',,,-ie
                so  far  aeveloped  are  d2-propoxyphene   (Darvan,   Lilly)   and
                ethchepta,-.Ine  (Zactir-fn2  Wyeth).   They   are   substantially
                less addicting than codeine and neither Is subject to
                narcotic  control  but  'they  are  not  as  effective  as   codeine
                in  relief  of  pain.  Two   effective   cough   suppressants   have
                been  discovered  and'are  on  the  market.   The2y   are   dextro-
                methordhans  Romilar,  a  synthetic,   and   narcotine   a   by-
                product  of  opium  processing.   A   @otent   synthetic   anti-
                diarrheal  or   constipating   agent   R-1132)   has-also   been
                discovered  which  Is  effective  In  doses  of  5-10  Tg   three
                times daily.  It has definite addiction liability but most
                probably  It  would  be 2 less  subject  to  abuse  than   codeine.
                     During  the  current  year  advances  were  rtade  in   the
                methodology  for  measuring  abuse-liability   of   ne%i   drucs.
                By employing a spec;-ally devised "attitude" questionnaire.,
                It  was  found  that  there  is  considerable   variation   among
                narcotic  drugs  Insofar  as  they  are  identified   as   "dope"
                (2opiates),  and   addicts   express   definite   oreferences.   As
                an  adjunct  to  objective  measurements   such   an   "attitude"
                questionnaire  should  be  useful  and  si.-,iple  procedure  for
                evaluating the rela*,ive abuse liability of.new synthetics.
                Formerly in man, the -riethod for evaluating drugs by
                direct addiction (a procedure which simula2tes tha-"6 e,,rployed
                by the  addict  in  his  abuse  of  drugs)  required  from  'Lwo  to
                six  months  to  complete.  P-xperiments   during   the   current
                year  demonstrated  that  In  the  cases  of  -.,ornhine,  codeine
                and he-oin, a relatively hi-h ngree oL' to-crance and
                physical dencndence develope wtien these dr8i-,gs are chronically
                adminl-i*tle.-ed foe only 13-20 da@s.  Th'Ls  shortcnc-",  "-.busell

              with that of morphine In the same Individuals.
                  Addiction studies were completed on 9 new compounds.
              Evaluation of 04.wo of these has been tubmitted to the Commil'.+-,z
              on Drug Addiction and 'f@larcotics, in'ational Research  Council
              (phenazoclne and levophenacylmorphan).  Both of these drugs
              were more'potent t2han morphine in Inducing motphine-like
              iteuphoria" and behavi,or and  both  completely  substituted
              for  morphine in addicted persons.  Although definite physicol-.
              dependence developed following chronic administratici@ of both
              of these compounds, the degree of physical dependence was
              less than that observed  in  the  case  of  morphine.  Their
              effectiveness by the ora2l route has been inadequately explored.
                   A conpound related to nalorphine structurallv (1-3-
              hydroxy-N-gar,L-i,a gari,@-,ia-dimethylallylmorphinan) was te7sted for
              addiction liability. In  postadaicts,  its  effec-L,.s  resemble
              those of morphine,  rather  than  nalorphine  and  therefore  It
              has no advantages at a substitute for c2odeine.
                   A new very potcnt compound, 1-(Beta-diethylaminoethyl)-
              2-(p-ethoxy-benzyl)..!.5-nitrobenzimidazole methane sulfonate,
              has been developed-by Ciba.  In maa-s the eu hariant dose,
              on oral administration, was  about  0.25  mg  (EO-120  times  as
              potent as  oral  morphine).  It  was  60  times  as  effective
              orally 2as-morphine is subcutaneously in suppressing abstinence
              from  moi@'phine.  During  chronic  administration,,  postaddicts
              were much ir,.pressed by its overall sedative effects, although
              they  recognized.it  as  opiate-like.  Since   the   compound
              Induces  definite  tolerance  and  physical  dependence   its
              addiction liability  would  approximate  that  of  -.iorphine.
                  2                   P=4S FOR FUTURE
                   Studies an several compounds have been completed and
              these will be prepared for publication.  New drugs to be
              studied are (a)  a  butyl  ester  of  R-11'2  (the  antidiarrheal
              agent), (b) the methyl analogue of phenazocine (the counter-
              part of codeine  in  this  series)  and  (c).  1-3-hydroxy-N-
              propargy2l-morphinan  hydrobromide,  an  anatgesic   which   Is
              a morphine  antagonist,  and  hence  probably  of  low  addiction
              liability.  From the long-range point of view It is intended
              to continue the search for substitutes for codeine until
              drugs are found Vnich are.,-Ln the opinion of--the  Com.--,iittee
              on Drug Addiction and Narcotics, completely satisfactory
              substitut2es for codeine.
