                              This session was opened        by a briefing and a lengthy djscussion
                         of the experiments involving         "normal" activity and the relationship
                         these experiments had to some operational problems.  After which
                         the following experiments were discusse2d:

                               This test is regarded as important            in   that    it   2 demonstrates

                             Both tests 1 and 2 regarded as highly successful
                       and of high operational value.
