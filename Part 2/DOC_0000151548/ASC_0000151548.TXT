                On checking I find that I have  onl.y 50 mg. of the drug  W-57.
                Chemically this compound is 6-methyl-4,-6-desoxymorphine.

                I am'also enclosin@ tables of the  preliminary tabulations
                on C-9 and @,'X.  Thes'e experiment2s were preceded by preli.,iiinary

                cardiovascular changes. Thereafter, a  comparison  was  carried
                out in 15"subjects, using the randomized Latin  Square  design.
                The drugs tested were placebo; 0.6 mg2 Aa (per 70 kilos);
                I mg ?AX (per 70 kilos); and I mg. C-9 (per 70 kilos).  %Ieasure-
                ments including reclining pulse rate (af4'.er 10 minutes in bed);
                standing pulse rate (counted for one minute after standing
                for one minute); and numbe@- of positive responses to a  simple
                system check-list based on our earlier work wi4.-h C-9.
          4      Two tables are enclosed.  One shows the time course of the
                             'L f f e
                effect with d-   -rent drugs.  In this table.it is evident
                that t,ie effect does not be.ain ul-,til the s-econd hour and
                persists at least until the twelfth hour.

                                                                  Page 2
               The second  table shows the alerage changes with the four
               different combinations.  You will notice that    there is a
               distinct difference between both doses of @,@X  and  placebo,
               as well as between C-9  and placebo.  There is also a definite
               dose response between the O.'O- and 1.0-mg. level with  ,.4X.
               There may be a *,.endency for cardiovascular effects  of  C-9
               to be more pronounced in the  overall  course.  I  cannot  be
               certain of this until the st'.atist;.cal analysis has been
               comp,eted.  1,Vhen this is accomdlished I will send you
               another'reloort and wi,ll also work up table showing the
               details on the ca9rdiovascular measurements made in the
               older work with C-9.
