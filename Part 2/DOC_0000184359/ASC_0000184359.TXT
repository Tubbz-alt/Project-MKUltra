              We have some electronic equipment which ve believe may be of interest
          to you.  It is made up of four separate units.  The first unit is a tape
          recorder of extremely high fidelity capable of reproducing in intimate
          detail all the inflections, nuances, and tones encountered in hirman speech.
          The recording can then be played back through the second unit, a specially
          designed oscilloscopic device which 2flashes on a screen in the most exact
          detail a moving picture of these inflections and tonal qualities.
              The third unit may be employed to halve the speed of the recording
          and, in turn, to double the resultant sound frequency thub providing a
          geometrically perfect picture of a spoken 'word with this picture moving
          at a rate slow enough to.permit careful visual examination.
                fourth unit permits the transfer of2 these oscilloscopic curves to
          a pe  nent paper record for static visual analysis and comparison.
              This equipment group can be used in making almost micrometric analyses
          of the speech characteristics peculiar to a particular locale.  Direct com-
          parisons can be made of the speech habits of individuals known to come fr=
          a particular place with those of another person allegedly from the same
          place but who may be suspect.
      0        This same equipment may be used for polishing away speech habits
          which might result in the detection of an operative.
              We would appreciate an opportunity to discuss this matter with you in
          greater detail at your convenience.
