                             At  the  n -"alo   of t           discussion, the writer

                             At the conclusion of those tests, i-,he writer ran again a
                       very slow  relaxing  tests in which  all  subject pa2rticipated.  After
                                                                                     ions

                       eye concentration test.  In the abb've, no outstanding results were
                       achielued but it should be noted for the record that no extensive
                       ef2fort was made-to obtain a -@eep hypnotic state in any of the
                       individuals present.  It should also be noted that these new'
                       volunteers all expressed continued interest and a willingness
                       to continue work along these lines.
                             Special Comment:   The writer notes that it is considei-abiy
                              difficult to d6h conduct intensive H woi-k with as many as
             2                 five volunteers in the operatlons room for various reasons.
                              The first is the room is crowded, the second is'the air
                              conditioning unit is not functionina and the air becomes
                               stale with cigarette smoke and tht-- third is that it is
                              difficult to concentrate on one individual at the expense
                              of th8e others present since it is important in this work
                              to maintain the absolute interest of all volunteers present.
