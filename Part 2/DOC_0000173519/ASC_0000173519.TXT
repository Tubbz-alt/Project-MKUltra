                                        INTRODUCTION
                                                 ha s c ond uc ted an inve s tigation of the
          The
          Kirlian photographic technique in an attempt to detect the presence of a
                                                      Dyfonate) in various species of
          commer2cial soil insecticide
          plants.  Dyfonate is a 57a granu'Lar organo-phosphorus soil insectide, said to be
          a non- systemic agent.  The insecticide. solution was poured over each leaf
          and ultimately accumulated in the soil of the individual pot.
          Vibrator excited, dampened high-voltage pulses were applied to radishes,
          pinto beans, and harvester beans in the Kirlian camera.  Color pictures were
          taken of plants in the untre9ated control group, low dosage and high dosage
          groups at intervals of one, two and four days after exposure.

                                 SUMMARY AND CONCLUS101",'S
           The pliotographs appear to show no gross changes from day to day or between
           control and the two treated groups.  This result does not necessarily indicate
           that the Kirlian technique is incapable of detecting this organo-phosphorous
           insecticide since spectroscopic analysis was not carried out.  Also, if the
           acyent is truly non-systemic, lar1ge-concentrations would not be expected on
           the leaves.  Further investigation using systemic insecticides such as
           Di Syston or Furadan could have positive results when applied in a carefully
           controlled test.

           A high voltage oscillitor was designed and constructed to be used in the Kirlian
           carnera.  The schematic is as follows:

            amplitudes of about -4 KV   and + 3 KV. Pulse  width  is  about  100us  and  pulse
            repetition frequency @ibout  100 pulses per second.

           for the two treated groups.  The age of the plants at the start of the test

           The control and treated plants were photographed on the first, second and
           fourth day following exposure.  In addition, the control group was photographed
           the day the treatment group was exposed.
