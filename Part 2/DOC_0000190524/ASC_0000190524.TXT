                   hypnotic experiments would perhaps become boring and re
                   of interest  by  all  persons  involved.  It  was,  thereforp,2-decided  to
                   attempt a different type  of  experiment  for  this  partir-ular  session.
                                            as decided to carry out  a  very  brief  ESP  ex-

                        The first test consisted    of having each girl  in  turn,  turn  the
                    entire dec2k of 25 cards while   seated at'a sniall table a; one  -end  of
                    the Operations Room. As the  word  "turn"  was  said  by  the  writer  at
                    ten second intervals, the other girl would be seated during the test
                    at the opposite end of the  room  on  the  sofa.  The  the  girl  turning
                    the cards would mark down the card turned and the girl reeniving
                    would write.down one of the five symbols a2s the thoughts of what
                    card had been turned passed into her mind.  The first test was done
                    with both girls completely awake and the results were as follows:
                                                        and

                       For-a matter  of record, it should be noted tha                 tually
                  took five pictures since the timing mechanism of th     cuier  "wa  off
                    and merely exploded the bulb without operating the trigger  mechanism
                              ra.  At the completion of th2e tests of taking    the pictures,
                              eturned returned the camera, reentered the OperRtions Room,
                    sat     on the sofa, and went into a deep sleep state.  Both girls
                  were then  given instructions for complete amnesia of the    whole ex-
                                                                               both     S

                    a  2    tal amnesia of the photograph activities and
                         s owed the camera to both girls they denied having    seen one
                    e   lone having taken pictures with it.
                        The above experiment is only of interest in that it    helps
                    normal activity" and individuals for operating complicated mechanisms
                   while in a deep sleep state.  It is also interesing in that it    shows
                    that individuals 5operating in a complete sleep state are not awakened
                      yflash bulbs or other disconcerting sounds if properly conditioned.

                         The pictures in the above test were developed the following
                   morning and only two of the actual four photographs were successful.
                    These are attached for record purposes only.
