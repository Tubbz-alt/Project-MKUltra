                         Sixty rats were divided into ten comparable groups of
                  three males and three females each. Only six animals per level
                  were used due to the limited amount of material.  The average
                  initial weight of the groups ranged between 77 and 84 gram >1p.
                  C>2p-102>1p, suspended in a 20 percent solution of polyv >1pinylpyrrolidone>1p,
                  was administered to2 nine of the groups at logarithmic dose levels
                  of >1p1>1p0>1p.>1p0>1p, 17>1p.8>1p, 31>1p.6>1p, 56>1p.3>1p, >1p1>1p0>1p0>1p.>1p0>1p, 17>1p8>1p.0>1p, 316>1p.0>1p,

                  mg/kg. The tenth group served as controls. Animals were
                  weighed >1p(>2p.>2p,>2pIppendix>1p) and observed for symptoms as required

                  24 hour weight gain suppression curve was determined (Figure V>1p)>1p.
                         No obje>2pbtive sy>1pmtoms were observed at the lowest level.
                         C>2p-102>1p, administered orally, produced a hypoactive effect
                  at all but the two lowest levels wit>2phin >1p0>1p. >1p5 to >1p1>1p. >1p5 hours. The number
                  of hypoactive animals increased from three at the 31>1p.26 mg/kg level
                  to six at all levels above >1p1>1p0>1p0>1p. >1p0 mg/kg. Animals remained in a
                  hypoactive state for about 6 hours at the 31>1p.6 mg/kg level to as long
                  as 48 hours at the >1p1>1p0>1p0>1p0>1p. >1p0 mg/kg level. Althouah hypoactive>1p, the
                  animals at all but the >1p1>1p0>1p0>1p0>1p. >1p0 mg/kg level were easily aroused and

                  alerted by external stimuli. Handling the animals, or a sudden
                  movement or noise, would cause an increase in activity for
                  approximately I minute, after which the animals would again
                  return to their hypoactive states. Hypoact>2pive animals at the
                  highest level became lethargic and were not easily aroused. During
                  the period of hypoac2tivity>1p, one to three animals at all but the lowest
                  level were observed to intermittently wash themselves more than
                  normal for periods ranging from >1p1 to >1p5 hours.
                         An excessive chewing phenomenon was exhibited by two
                  animals at each of the 31>1p.6>1p, 56>1p.3 and >1p1>1p0>1p0>1p. >1p0 mg/kg levels, three
                  animals at the 178>1p. >1p0 mg/kg level, and all animals above 178>1p. >1p0 mg/kg.
              2    Thi>1p.5 symptom increased in degree of effect as the dosage increased
                  until one-half the animals per level at the three highest levels would
                  come to and chew on paper >2pheld six to twe>2plve inches away.
                         Hypersensitivity to touch was observed in two and one
                  animals. respectively, at the 31>1p.6 and 55>1p.3 mg/kg levels. A maximum
                  number of five hypersensitive animals was observed at the 563>1p. >1p0 mg3/kg
                  level. The hypersensitivity o>2pccurred I to 4 hours after administration
                  and, lasted for 2>1p.5 hours at the lowest observed level to a maximum of
                  about 24 hours at the higher levels.
                         A decreased respiratory rate was >1po bserved at all but the

                 These symptoms increased in frequency and amplitude as the dosage
                 increased and were exhibited by animals at the >1p1>1p0>1p0>1p0>1p. >1p0 >1prrig>1p/kg level
                 for as long as I day. Animals exhibiting the awkward gait would
                 stop in unusual positions with fore>2ptimbs>1p. ext2ended anteriorly and hind-
                 limbs extended posteriorly.
                         Both diarrhea and diuresis were observed in one to three
                 animals per level at all but the lowest dosage level, but were not
                 proportional to the dosage.
                         A low peripheral temperature, observed in one animal at
                 the 178>1p. >1p0 mg/kg level, i>2pn>2pcreased>2p. in frequency to a maximum of fiv>2pt
                 animals at the high2est level.  The low periphera>2pl temperature occurred
                 from, 2>1p.25 to >1p5 hours after administration and had a duration of less
                 then 24 hours in all cases.
                         No deaths  occurred at any of the levels tested. Symptom dose
                 50>1p's (Table VIII>1p) were calculated by the method of Litchfield and
                 Fertig>1p.  The 24 hour suppression of- weight gain (Figure V>1p) determined
                 as described in the Apri4l report, varied between zero and >1p1>1p8>1p8 percent
                 for females and zero and 198 percent for males. - The 24 hour >1p5>1p0
                 percent weight gain suppression was 27>1p. 07 mg/kg with a slope of
                 283 for females, and 63>1p.1 >2pr>1p.>2p,>2png>1p/kg with a slope of 2>2p38 for males.  rhe
                 suppression of weight gain was proportional  to dosage level up through
                 the 316>1p.0 mg/kg level.
