                                                      y
                   collection trip by           NRUMINNNWY OSI, to Mexico and certain
                   Latin Amrican areas--for th'e purpose of obtaining rare botanical
                   materials having properties of interest to ARTICHOKE.
                   conpleted this trip about the2 end of February 1953 and obtain'ed a
                   number of such botazdcals.  Subsequently, during l,larch-an      @ril
                   1953, this Office picked up the raw botanicals fro-.
                   and trans,,TLitted them tc    I-PA APP--WM'FL--V--     Four type-s were
                   transiiiitted'in considerable bu-Uc--ce'rt.&-:,-nl2y suf icient for various
                   analyses.  These types were as follo@is:
                     i@-@       a. Piule (Rivea)
                               ib.       (Rynchosia)
                                   Abrus
                   z,c             Erythr3-n
                         2.  In addition, a considerable bulk of the     barl@ Pisci-oula
          14       which           VW had obtained2 was transmitted at about this
                   period.
                         3.  It was at-reed, if you will   recall., at this time,  that  TSS
                   working throurfh its  various  ramifications  would  have  these  botanicals
                                 c@                                                                     i@
                   studied and examined to deternline whether or not they were of future
                 2  value to ARTICHOKE.
                         4.  Since that time (April 1953),    this Office has not received
                   any type of written report nor have we received any-thing but a few
                   vague oral statements as to what has  been  done  or  what  results  have
                   been obtained from the study of tfiese materials.
                         5.  It   . ht be well to  mention  for  the  record  that  in  adat-on
          2                                         -taine
                   to the above,,,.      -%NW ob         d at least fifteen  (15)  more  in-
                   terestiiig  bot       which were also offered in early 1953 to TSS
                   for examination. In this,  however,  TSS  requested  us  not  to  deliver
                   these materials since they were already swamped by the above
                   deliveries.  Again we have never been asked to bring in these
 0                  addi'u4onal materia3-s for study.

                      6.  In vie@; of t'ihe-aforemntioned, it is respectfully requested
                that an official inquiry be made through SO channels to TSS for fu-U,
                detailed and complete reports on the work done and results in the
                exaxd.nation and study of the botanicals referred to above in
                Paragraph 1.
               A"     7.  Since you are well aware of our present2 corlm'tments to
                    it is certainl- unnecessary to urge the highest possible
                priority in the handling of this matter.
