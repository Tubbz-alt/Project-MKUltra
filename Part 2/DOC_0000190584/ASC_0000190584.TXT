                   an excellent test of control would be to see how quickly and easily
                   a deep H sleep could be induced 4'thout             us buildup 2or slow
                   induction.  Acc              aFlr@-e7en               nstructed the

                        No extensive tests were made except   some normal movement and
                   lawakening tests.  Session was concluded  at approximately 9:00 PM.
