                 group was abseA@....
                     In vicw of the fact  that this was the first effort for   the new subjects,
                 approximately one hour of  the total time was devoted to a security briefing
                 and a.gener@il 2briefing of  t@e work,of the girls in connection  with  the  overall
                 ARTICHOKE- program.  Thereafter, the irriter took each one of the girls in turn
                 and tested them on the standard "falling back" tests and all subjects responded
                 in a more or less average fashion.  After some discussion, the writer then
                 tested all subjects on the "hand rising" test.  Re2sults were fair orLTy @qith
                 some ai the girls respondin,- to a slight extent and others showing little in-
                 clination to respond to the suggestion.  Ho,,;ever, the writer does not regard
                 this as unusual since all were now subjects and close together at the time.
                      Again at the conclusion of this test, a genera.1 discussion ,;as entered
                 into afte2r which a rery slow llrola--cation" in                   l@@iter with
                 a            participating.  On this test,
                 _Jim&
                            "-apparently approached a light 'sf6ep state but@              as unable
                    do arqthing in the test apparently because of a nervous       e of agitation.
                      In general,, it may be said the tests  were completely incon2clusive and
                 in the opinion of the writer all sul)jects  acted somewhat below average  which
                 was due to the fadt that people were very   closely associated with each   other
                 and the girls could not concentrate as well as if only          d be,r3n_Wesent
                           were conducted by the writer since he wished                     and

                 't s7t%r-to the general briefing on new  subjects.  Furthermore,  the  writer  felt
                 that the main objOCtiVe3 of the night were not  to  produce  exceptional  results
                 in the tests but to obtain the interest and future  co-operation  of  these  sub-
                 jects.
