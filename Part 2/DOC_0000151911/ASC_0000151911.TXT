                        EFFECT OF EPINR--PHRINE ON THE LSD      REACTION
                   @lany of the effects   of LSD. In animals  and man  suggest   a
             state of hyperactivity of     the adrenergic autonomic    nervous
             system.  Rothlin has postulated     that LSD creates a    central
             hyperactive  autonomic  state.  Dille  and  his  coworkers   at   the
             University  of  Washin  ton  found  that   phenoxybenzamine 2  blocked
             LSD-induced hyperthermia and behavioral changes in animals.  The
             same  group  found  that  administration  of  LSD  two  hours  after
             reserpine  resulted   I.n marked augmentation of the LSD hyperthermi'a,
             whereas administration of LSD ten hours after reserp;-ne resulted
             In  little  hyperthermia.  Since  reserpine  is-knoern  to  cause   a
             discharge  of  serotonin  and  2norepinephrine  in  the  brain,   the
             change two hours after reserpine might b
                                                          e  correlated  with   a
             discharge  of  epinephrine  and  norepinephrine.,  whereas  at   ten
             hours  these  substances  would  be  depleted  in  the  tissues.   in
             recent experfirents  we  were  unable  to  show  any  diminution  in the
             Intensity of the mental    sy@p*@oms i2nduced by LSD f---c, prc,rea,6-

                Discussion.  Like the  4xperiment with  phenoxybenzamine,
           the restlts.do not favor., but also do not  disprove, the
           adrenergid hypothesis of  the LSD reaction.  In  this connection,
          ---it is important to remember that epinephrine is known to have
           effects  on the central nervous system (changes  in the activity
           of the reticular activating system), so that the lack of effect
          7 is probably   not Attributable to difficulty in penetration of
           the  blood  brain barrier by epinephrine.
