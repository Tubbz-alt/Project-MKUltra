                  Reference is made to your informal memorandum of 14 May 1951,,  and
        at,tached docwients concerni.ng a neri type of oscilloscopic device with
        extremly high fidelity tape recorder6
                   2               the writer feel that such a device may be  of  con-
        siderable interest both to general I & SO work and to  special  Bluebird
        interests.  It is also'felt that it may be of value to agency field units*
                  it is t       e reqtiested that arrangements be made as soon as
        possible f or4           and th  writer to examine and test this machine
        lc,cally if one is ava  ble or if not obtain from  h         ctu

        operational and technical details for our study*
        opinion that this equipment will be qui.te bulky an very  expensive  and
        thorough investigation should be made before committing ourselves to purchase.
                  For your consideration and based upon the  meager  2information
        filrrished us coricerni.ng the oscil-loseopic device,, we have set out below
        several poss@ible (and valuable) uses to wlich the device could be employed
        if found to be practical and operationally sound:
                  la  It could be used for very high level identification*
                  2&  It could be possibly used for testing identification  under S*Io
                  39  It possi1bly could be used on a large scale as a security check
                      using given code words or phrases,
                      Bluebird is always interested in very high fidelity tape or
                      other type recordbrs.
                  5.  It may possibl-y be of extreme value in determining key  sounds
                      or key words made by human voice in S,I, techniques.
