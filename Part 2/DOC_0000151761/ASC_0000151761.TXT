                                  ELYZAOCLAVINR- (43-Y).
                Elymo@-lavine (V'-A-22) is a material isolated from a cultured
            saprophytic fungus by the Research Laboratories of Tal,,eda
            Pharmaceu'6ical Industries in,-Japan.  It is related to agro-
            cla-,rine (V-A-18) and @o d@lhydroagroclavin2e, both of vinich have
            sedative and hypnot-ic  effects in man,,-although they are
            primarily expitant in   animals.   All these drugs are related to
            the ergot group. 'In   elymoclavine the  acid  amide  group  of  LSD
            has been replaced with a hydrogen and a C"20H group.
               .Accord'ing to Yu! and Takeo (1) agroclanrine and elymocla-vinc
            cause a syndrome 0"'L' "cen+-ral sympathetic excitatio-,i" in  mice,
            rabbits, cats and dogs manifested by mydriasis, tachypnea,
            convulsions, hyperactivity, etc; whereas dihydroagroclavine,
            dihydroergokryptine, etc., cause sedation.  r-.Iymoclavine and
            agroclavine had analeptic effects in reserpine sedated mice.
                Because of discr  epancy In the effects of agrocla   vin-e (in
    0        animals, excitation  and  in  man,  sedation)  a  preliminary  study
            of elymoclavine was  thought  to  be  of  Interest.  The  study  was
            designed to determine the effective dose range  in  ria,-i,  and  to
            determine  if  LSD-like  (psychosomirietic)  effects  were  induced.

                                                                   Paoe
                                     METHODS
              Sub.iects.  Nontolerant former opi.ate addicts who were
           serving sentences for violating the Federal narcotic laws
           volunteered for these experiments.  All were healthy males
           between 21 and 40 years.of age who presented no evidence of
           any of the major psychoses on mental status examinations.  All
           had experienced the e.tfects of LSD-25,in previous experiments.
               C-eneral Conditions.  The experiments were conducted in a
           special ward.  Pa.tients entered this ward on the night before
           experiments were conducted,, and were observed hourly by
           specially.trained attendants.  Between observations the patients
           were free to remain in their own rooms, to slee p or to socialize
      2     wi'6h other pati-ents in a comnon day room.
              'Dru2s.  Elymoclavine was given orally in solution at 8 a.m.
           The taste was,ma:s.ked with cherry syrup.
               In preliminary experiments', the dose of elymoclavine was
           cautiously elevated from 1 Tncg/kg to 7.5 mcg/kg.  No psycho-
           somi,netic effects were observed, and with the larger doses
           patients began to reoort9 headaches and'drowsiness.  Accordingly

                                                                   Pa@;s
           more formal 'experiments were carried out in which 12 patients
           received on two separate occasions 10 and 15 mcg/kg of V-A-22.
           In addition, 5 patients'received PO mcg/kg'and 4 received
           2r' mcg/kg.
              Observations.  The fo-Ilowing observations were ma,,Ie at
           hourly inter2vals twice before,,and eight times after adminis-
           tration of V-A-22:  pi@pillary size, sys-tolic blood pressure,
           and threshold for eliciting the kneejerk.  In addition patients
           completed a questionnaire houriyl with the help of an aide, and
           short meii",6al status examinations were made at appro-riate
           intervals.  The methods of making the observat'.1o.,is and analyzing
  2         the data were described by Isbell et al (2,3).  For comt)arative
           purdoses, data on 9 other subjects who received a placebo and
           1.0 mcg,/Ag of LSD in other experiments are included.
                                      RESULTS
               The combined data are presented in Table I which shows that3
           as compared with LSa, elymoclavine had relatively minor effects
           on pupillary diamet9er, threshold for kneejerk, and blood
           pressure (except at-the 25 mcg/kg level).  The table also shows
           the lack of any psychosomimetic effect, even w;-th 25 mcg/kg.
           Positive responses on the questionnaire after ely-loclavine were
           usually to such Items as:  "I feel sleet)y," 'IT am iiauseated et--*

                                                                   P a
              V-A-22 dido however, induce symptoms differing from those
          of LSD.  The most commonly reported symptoms were sleepiness
          and relaxation.(Table 2).
                                   DISCLJSSION
              Like agroclavine and Lilr@ 23194, elymoclavine had sedative
          effect, rather than ps7,ychosomimetic effects in man.  Whet4her
          such sedation could-be  exploite.d therapeutically remains to be
          determined.
              In further work, the sleed-inducing properties of elymoclavine
          should be compared with those of a barbiturate.
