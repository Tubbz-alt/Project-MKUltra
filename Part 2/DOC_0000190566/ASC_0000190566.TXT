                          Prior to the  first  test,   stibjects were briefed and a,discussion
                     was hild concerning previous work and some coiitemplated future ac-
                     tivity.
                          The first test was  a  continuation  of  the  "normal"  movement,
                     winorma2l" conversation and message transmittal test.  Each test being
                     run separately with one subject workina--al           e other two observing.
                     'nie test itself  corisisted of placin                n Iloom 3  and  giving
                     him  a code word. Then each subject  in  t  @@was  placed  in  a  deep
                     trance state  in  Oil lini,.aadowere told to riemorize a2 sentence which
                     they could rey at t               nly after ki-- h.,id used the code word.

                     then tried to get each subject to glp                   message"     without
                     using the code word.      In each cas                 as  un@@@le to   obtain

                     Room tio. 3  and  a  general  discussion  was  held  regarding   the   above
                     tests.
                          The  next  test  was  designed  to  carefully   observe   all   subjects
                                                      ng in a "norniall' social tyl)e  conver-

                     state was
                     after, a   general  rambling discussion wa.9 held in which all         hands
                     .,participated." This lasted about,.15 to  20  minutes  when  subjects

                  were returned to trance states, then  awakened.  Ali  had  total  attiiiesia,
                  but discussion afterward restored 1)artial memory.
                      it is of'int,--rest to note that a special hallucination test, under-
                  taken during the  above  test  was  unsuccessful--probably  due  to  improoer
     2             preparation and confusion.  This, however, is not regarded as important
                  -at this time.
                      The third  test  was  aimed  at  perfecting  tiie  regression  techniques
                  of the operation and o@,serving and studying sut@jects in regressed
                  states.  This test is regarded as I)eing.very important and B will
                  make every i3ffort to develop this techniqu2e since in information
                  obtaining activities successful regression riay be vital.

                       In general,  the  tests  were  moderately  successful,  l,ut  regression
                  was only partially  ol)tained  and  there  were  no  markedly  characteristic
                                  or  spontaneous  talking.  What  information  that  was   ob-

                  tained was obtained by questioning an(i none of the su@-jects "r2e-live(I'l
