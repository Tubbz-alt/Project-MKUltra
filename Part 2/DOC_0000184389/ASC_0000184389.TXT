                              necessitate the addition of the third clerlc-typist (GS-2) listed above
                              and the elevation of the more experienced  clerk-typist now -with the
                        9      project to semi-bibliographic work.   In-&,rade raises have increased the
                              total of salaries required.   The only promotions now expected are from
                              GS-3 to C:S-4 snd from GS-2 to GS-3.   A Bibliograplier' GS-7 soon to be
                              promoted to GS-9 will be rotated out of the project and replaced by
                              another GS-7.
