                      SIGNIFICANT ASPECTS:      The work appears to be the necessary
                      basic research on a drug whose impact on society was just beginning.
                      The studies included the use of LSD in therapy.  As far as is
                      known, subjects in this experimentation were witting.  Funds are
                                      2                          -Project No. 7's
                      included for the payment of subjects.  Sub
                      proposal contains the following quotation:
                          "One of the difficulties of deter,-nining explicitly
                                     of the drug itself is that the subject

                          in the next year, subjects on the
                          who are essentially normal      a psychiatric point
                          of view, will be given unwitting dosesoi' the drug
                          for psychotherapeutic purposes.  In this way more
                          valuable experiments will probably be carried out
  2                        in spite of hospital condiL@ions."
                    It is not known whether unwitting, in this case, meant  fully
                    unwitting or unwitting as to timing.  It is also unknown
                    whether unwitting doses were actually given.

                    chemical, neurophysiological, sociological, and clinical
                    psychiatric aspects of LSD, and also a study of LSD antagonists
                    2and drugs related to LSD, such as L.A.E. (Lysergic Acid
                    Ethylamide).  Twelve volun@'.eers at the
                    were tested to determine the clinical effects of LSD on the
                    adrenal cor@Lex.  In another experimen-@.-, it was observed that
                    there were autonomic (involunt'ary nervous sys'::-@'M) disl-urbances
          2          following the administration of LSD.  Other experiments were
                    conducted to make clinical psychiatric evaluations of the
                    reactions of all subjects who received LSD and of the effect
                    other drugs had when administered in combination with LSD.
                    The psychological experiments administered tests to individuals
                    while under the influence of LSD; the results sho0wed lowered
                    abilities.  The files.-indicate tha'L. the testing was done on
                    volunteers.

                         treason or change loyalties; (2) To develop skills by which
                         potential defectors can be detected; and (3) To develop methods
                         for increasing the chances of2de@i@ection of various target indi-
                         viduals.  Sampling techniques from information gathered from
                         Hungarian defectors was used.
