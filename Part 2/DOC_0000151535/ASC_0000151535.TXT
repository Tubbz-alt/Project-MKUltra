                 was away  from  Lexins'ton last week  so  the  preliminary
                description of' the C-9 could not  be  c2ompleted  until  my
                return.  This has now been finished and Is attached      to
                the original [.,etter.
                since writihgl'you on Iviay 2;')rd the work with Frenquel orally
               .as a blocker of LSD has been completed and table Giving the
                results is at4,ached.  You will note that the differcnces
                b2etween placcbo-LSD and Frenguel-LSD are insignificant.  It
                Is concluded that ln:the doeage used F,-o.,nquet is Ineffective
                in aiterine the LSD-reaction.  I 'am., of course, sending
                these data on to th@Win. S. i'v@ierrell Company, who so.kindl,/
                suppllzd .-,e with the.-drug.  I am, als'o thinkirig of sendin2g
                a short rojc to Selence concerning these negative results.
                Tri' als of slnfhetic LSD are underway.  Mild but defivi c
                LSD-like -cffects hav- been observed with this material in
                doses of 25 mc-M. Trials of larger doses should begin
                next week.
                                        Very sincerely yours,
