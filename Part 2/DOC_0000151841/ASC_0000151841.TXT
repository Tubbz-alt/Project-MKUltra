                     WITH THOSE OF C>1p-9 DISSOLVED IN ALCOHOL.
          PURPOSE:  To determine if C>1p-9 dissolved In oil is as active as
          C>1p-9 dissolved In alcohol and administered dispersed in watery
          solution,
          >2pM>2pETHODS>1p:
              Subjects:  Five nontolerant former morphine addicts, all
      2    male, who were serving sentences for violation  of the federal
          narcotic laws were used in these experiments.   All were phys>2pi>2p->1p.ally
          healthy, presented no evidence of the major psychoses, and all
          had experienced the effects of marihuana in a  free  environment.
              Drugs:  All drugs wer>2pe given at >1p8 a.m. with the patients
          fasting.  C>1p-9 was available as a solution containing >1p1>1p0 mg/ml
          in vegetable oil In perles>1p.  The perl2es were opened, the doses
          measured and diluted with >1p8 cc of vegeta>2pb le oil >1p(>1p">2p,>2pMazo>2pla>1p">1p)>1p.
          The glass was r>2p@nsed with 2 additional portions of 4 cc  of  oil.
          Vegetable oil containing no drug was used as a placebo.  C>1p-9 was
          also available as a solution of >1p1 m>2p.g>1p/m>2pi in 95 per cent  ethanol.
          The dose was measured and diluted with >1p8 cc of  distilled  water,
          forming a milky suspension.  The glass was rinsed 9with two portions
          of water.

              Design: -The patients received at weekly intervals, in a
           randomized, balanced order, the following drugs: >1p1>2p*>1p0 and >1p1>1p.>1p5 mg
           per 70 kg of C>1p-9>1p->2pin oil; >1p1>1p.>1p0 and >1p1>1p.>1p5 mg>1p/70 kg of C>1p-9 In alcohol;
           and a>2p.placebo>1p,  The patients were unaware of the Identity of the
           drugs ('single-blind" procedure).
              Observati2ons:  The following observations were made at
           hourly intervals twice before and eight times after the drugs:
           pulse rate and blood pressure after>1p.ten minutes rest in bed,
           pulse rate and blood pressure after arising from bed and standing
           quietly for one minute, and rectal temperature.  In addition,
           patients completed a questionnaire containing 67 items at hourly
           intervals.-once before and eight times after the drug.
              Analys_>2pi2s>1p:  In-the cases of r>2pectal temperature, resting and
           standing pulse rates, and resting and standing blood pressures,
           the values at each hour after the drug were subtracted from the
           average of the p>2pr>2p.edrug observations.  These values >2pf>2p-or change
           from control constituted time-action curves, so the are as under
           these curves were calculated and the usual statistical calcula>2p-
           tions made using the t>1p-test for paired observati4ons.  Questions.
           scored positively after the drugs were counted over the entire
           post-drug period, eliminating answers also scored-positively
           prior to the drug.

                                      RESULTS
              The results are su>2pm>2pmarized In table  >1p1>1p.  All  doses  of  C>1p-9
           In both alcohol and-oil co>2pnsistently elevated resting and

           pressure, and caused postural hypertension;  Rectal temperature
2           was not consistently affected. In  general,  C>1p-9  dissolved  in
           alcohol was consistently more effective than C>1p-9 disso>2pl>2pted in oil,
           thought the d>1piffer>2p.ences did not reach statistical significance,
           There was no significant difference in onset and peak time of
           the changes in pulse rate and  standing  blood  pressures.  The
           usual subjective reports >2p->2p->1p- change In mood, mild perceptual
           distortion  dry mouth, di2zziness and sleepiness >1p->1p- were
           reported after both oily and alcoholic solutions.
               Four of >1p5 patient>2ps f>2painted on standi>2png after >1p1>1p.>1p5 mg of >2pC>1p-9
           in alcohol, whereas only one of >1p5 fainted after >1p1>1p.>1p5 mg of >2pC>1p-9
           in oil.  One pat>2pi>1p'ent fainted after >1p1>1p.>1p0 mg In alcohol., and none
           after >1p1>1p.>1p0 mg in alcohol.
               Conclusion:  C>1p-9 dissolved In oil is effective In inducing
        4   postural hypertension and  marihuana-like  subjective  effects,
           but is probably less  effective than C>1p-9 in alcohol.
