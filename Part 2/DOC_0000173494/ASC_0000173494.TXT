                                                SUMMARY
                  The CIA-sponsored research project with  the Texas Research Institute'
             for Mental Sciences (TRIMS) was conducted to  improve the usefulness of.
             Physiological measurements as indicators-of emotional stress,.  The subject's
             were volunteer medical students who were both witting -and consenting.
             Measurements were made of such things as heart and breathing  ra2tes'of  the
             students during final  ex'am week when they were presumably under  more  ten-
             sion than at other times during the semester.  For comparison purposes$
             similar measurements.were taken during periods of non-ttress.
                                                                              During'one
             phase of the work, stimulants and depressants (barbiturates and amphet-
             amine) were administered to 7-8 2student volunteers to determine the effects
             of these drugs upon the baseline measurements being made. At  no  time  was
             LSD or any other hallucinogen used.

             List of Facts re Contracts  with Dr. Burch and  Texas  Research  Institute
             for Mental Sciences (TRIM-S-)
             Reference:  17 July 1975 AP wire story and Mr. Thuermer notes re
                           Washington Post reporter (Tom Curtis) conversation
                  1. Dr. Burch's  statement  concerning  Agency-sponsored  research  is
     2        true.
                  2. No LSD was used in  any  CIA-sponsored  activity  with  TRIMS.  We
             were not involved with LSD work for the Air  Force  that.is  mentioned  in
             the AP wire story. The contractor's  proposal  included  an  experiment  in
             which LSD might be used.  That work was not done.
                3.  Stimulants and depressants (Amphetamine and barbiturates) were
             administered to witting and consenting subjects 2to investigate the effects
             of such drugs upon the rates of physiological measurements, such as heart
             rate, breathing rate, and skin moisture.
             Y(        he studies were funded through the Air Force for the first tiiiee
               ars.    ency association with the activities was classified, however, the-.
             Director of TRIMS was totally aware of the source of funds.  Subsequently,
             research was        unc,ias2sified association) directly with Dr. Burch
             through TRIMS(/9,,6 -6g),
                  S.  The studies had  as their purpose the improvement  of  our  under-
             standing of physiological measurem@nts as indicators of emotional stress
             (the polygraph problem).  Another  possible  application  is  determination
             of evasiveness or deceptiveness--as indicated by observable physiological
             changes--aL-,.meetings between U.S. and foreign  officials.
                  6. The presence or absence  of  stress  was  inferred, in the first
             study, by making measurements of  medical  students  during final exam week
             and comparing the measurements with those  taken  at  other periods  during
             the semester. In the  latter  studies,  stress  was  produced by having  the
             volunteer students participate to varying degrees in-a mock crime situa-
       2      tion in which subjects pretended to steal an  object  and  then  attempted
             to deceive a polygraph operator about their '.guilt."
