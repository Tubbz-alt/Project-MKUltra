                                 as present, it was again decided to use her as an     example
                                 ther girls and this method was used throughout this   evenings
                     work.
                                 The first test of the evening consisted of a slow inducind
                     technique and in all three subjects, a medium trance was brought on
                     in about    six or seven minutes.  After inducing t2he trance state, the
                     writer returned all subjects to the awake state with the 12345 method
                      after giving the standard conditioning suggestions before awakening.
                                 Thereafter,               gan a series of tests with all
                      subjects   participating         tests were successful and each subject
                      was induced into a deeper trance than they had heretofore been able to
           2           attain.  Some tests were made of movement and simple post hy-pnotics.
                      Finally,   all subjects were tested with their eyes open and in short
                      conversations which were entirely successful.
                                 To demonstrate th             ppearance and the "telephone."
