                          1.    admire these people for their patience in trying for three years
                      to get something definitive.  I wonder why they neglected to include repro-
                      ductions of the polygraph charts used for their analyses.  It would be
                      real exciti2ng if I could do any better.
                          2.                           called and gave a bibliography reference
                      for parapsychology.  I have requested it.  He also said a man named
                               Ifrom NINH called and asked him if he knew of anyone in the US
                      working in parapsychology.        treferred him to
                          3.  It may be worth considering that psychokinesis occurs via an
                      en2ergy "exchange" or communication between the experimenter and the object.
                      Then assuming it is some form of energy, experiments can be performed
                      to make a systematic investigation into what form of energy (thermal,
                      radiative, etc.) is involved.  I suppose a term like "coupling energy"
                      might be introduced when some success is indicated.
                      P.S.  Would like to file with P8lant Sensors File
