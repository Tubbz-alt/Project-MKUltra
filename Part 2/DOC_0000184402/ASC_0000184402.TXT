                        1. In accordance with plans  established  at  the  conference  of  29.
                   January 1952,,-@@                        'attended 2a conference 4 Febru-
                   P-ry 1952 in                          in the
                   in connection with "Side Tone Delay" contract matters.
                        2.  Present at this conference were'                      who   of-
                   ficially represented. OSI and tliis'AgencyL                  who  is  head
                   of one of the special units of       and
                                               who are to carry ou2t the  research  in  con-
                   nection with the "Side Tone I)elay" devices.
                        3.                       position at the conference wa.s, of course,
                   official while                     attended for whatever assistance they
                   could
                         give and be::,,iL.se of immediate operational interests in the  "Side
                   Tone Delay" device.
    2                    4. The primary object of the  conference  was  to  come  to  an  agree-
                   ment or meeting of the minds as to spec4-ficallv what
                                 were to attempt to do with the $@4,000  before  the  matter
                   was officially negotiated as a contract by         After   considerable
                   discussion, it was agreed that                     would attcmpt to
                   develop devices along the "Side Tone Delay"  principles  which  could  be
                   used both at permanent installations and/o@:- E. portable type for  field
                   use.  It was also agreed that                     would  research  along
                   these lines, develop, if possible, a proto-type instrument, and if
                   this instrument Droved operationally sound, they would prepare in-
                   structions,, etc.ior its use and the t2echnique for using same.  In
                   addition, it was also agreed that-the research  would  be  general  and
                   would procede to@-iard an ultimate goal which would be,possibly  a  "Side
                   Tone Delay" device which would have no  attachments  on  an  individual
                   and yet would be capable of being used immediately in conjunction
                   with a polygranh or some other device whicli  would  indicate  deception.
2                   Furthermore, it was agreed that the research  was  not  to-be  directed
                   at an @Lrunediate and specific idea, but that it would be  developed  As
                   best thought out by                    with conferences  laid  on  when-
                   ever it was necessary to make an  important  decision  regarding  either
                   a change in the device or concentrating on  one  particular  device  or
                   techniqu0e.
                                                                                                    P-

                         5.  As far as security in this matter is concerned, the interests
                   of CIA, of course, is concealed since'from a fiscal point of view,
                   CIA merely is advancing @34,000 to        who is in turn paying the money
                   to                       The project itself is to be unclassi-."'ied  and
                   neither       nor this Agency will furnish                      any classi-
   2                fied material.
                         6.  As a protective device, the contract will    contain  a  clause
                   which will give this Agency the right to screen any written matter
                   concerning the "side tone delay"- prior  to  publication  and  also  this
                   Agency will have the right  to  purchase  any  instruments  developed  by
                   this research.  Furthermore,, it was agreed that this Agency could in-
             2      spect the progress of the research from time to time and if it was
                   being tested operationally, this Agency could participate in/and ob-
                   serve this testing.
                         7.  For a matter of record, contract negotiations between
                   and                     will be carried on by the special contract
                   section of,       A copy of this contract apparently will be given to
                                        for his2 files and reports, both fiscal and other-
                   wise will be furnished him from time to time by
                         8.  It was agreed by the a.. representatives and
                   that  the contract date for the beginning of the work would be 1 March
                   1952.
