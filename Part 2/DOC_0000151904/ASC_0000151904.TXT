           atte@pted to reproduce  their  experiment*,  using  doses  of  1-1.5
           MCGI.10 of LSD, but could show  no  significant  blocking.  Four  of
           the 8 pat-tenfs used, however, had very  minor  rca:cflons  to  LSD.
           The experiment, therefore, was repeated using larger doses of
           LSD In order to Insure a fairly marked degree of reaction.
