                         In Room 20, Building 13, on  10  July  1951,..re'search  in  SI  was
                     continued.

                     into SI within a matter o  one m nute or les's.  The state was
                     deepened by more sug    t' rL and the post IiI sugrestion @P

                     ject was  awakened.  This  again  would  indicate  that  association  with
                     the technique will  make  a  new  subject  more  susceptibleand  easier-to
                     accept SI suggestions.
                                                          .@6+,h are  consid2ered  excellent
                     subjects  ana were gi%V        6    tests to  determine  the  depth  and
                     were   awakened.
                          To keep interest high, all    subjects were @isked  to  enter  into
                     4 very informal discussion and  that  the  operator  would  be  very  glad
                     to answer any qitestions that came up.  As has always been the policy,
                     sul-jects are kept as  comple2tely  informed  as  possible  as  to  their
                     progress and what vaguely  we  are  attempting  to  accomplish  in  this
                     experimentation.  Subjects  are  continually  reminded  that  our   desire
                     is also to make them  feel  that  they  too  are  learning  and  bene-
                     fitting from the experimentation.
                                                          were  chosen  for  further  tests

                        pearance that differed very little than that of the  ak'n
                                                                              w  1

                        ope@r..ator suspected in one instance that she had  awakened.  This
                        was in  error.  She  performed  everything  suggested  completely  nor-
                        mally while still under SI. S2he was then  awakened  and  had  comf)lete
                        amnesia including the time that she appeared to be awake.

                        Subjects were told in advance exactly  what  the  operator  would  have
                        the subject do and that a  tape  recording  would  be  made  simultane-
                        ously. All three were then put into deep  SI  and  each  given  a  post
                        SI suggestion to perform and told that each  would  have  total  am-
                        nggia_f L                   pon  awakening.  All  were  then  awakened.

                        un                    asked that the  recording  just  made  be  played
                              el              SI given), that she would  like  to  hear  it.

                        then played and the three stated that even  after  hearing  the  re-
                        cording, all had absolute amnesia  for  everything  except  being  told
                        to go to sleep.

                        point,'she was asked to tell exactly what she was doing.  She     was
                        instructed that she c            clearly and  act  completely  normal,'

                        the incident she was  pparen    2 reliving.  She  described   being   on
