                       experiments  along  these  lines  have  been  universaliy  successful   and
                       interesting results have been obtained, but testing along agency
    2                   lines,  of-6ourse,  was  impossible  for  security   reasons.  It was,
                       therefore, decided to begin a spr           exl)eri       and because
                       of.the advanced Qapacities o                                   -it was

                       discussion, the following tests were run off:

                             The second test involved    a more complex method as follows:
                             Each girl was placed    In a deep 51 state in the Operations Rooiii.
