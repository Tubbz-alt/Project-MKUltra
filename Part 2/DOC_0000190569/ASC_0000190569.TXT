                 techniques and  all  subjects responded with great rapidity (5-20
                 seconcis) to induction to trance.  All subjects were given many
                 simple control, amnesia, and ddpth tests wfiicti indicated subjects
                 were ready for more 'gdvan'ced experimentation.
                  2    The advanced experiments  were  then  started  using  each  subject
                 in rotation while others observed--all subjects liav-Lng been briefed
                 in advance. These tests  were  designed  to  determine  whether  or  not
                 average indiv-iduals under 11 control could move,  talk,  and  think  in
                 a completely "normal" manner if so instructed.

                 should be  noted  that  the ability to act normally apparently    varies

                 be removed.  Tests were concluded with the    usual  precautionary   in-
