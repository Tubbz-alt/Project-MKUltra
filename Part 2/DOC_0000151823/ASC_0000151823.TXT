                   Do-you  have  any  infor:,nat;.oz, on the stal:.ililt,-,7 of C-5?
                   lire
                      have  been :naltin- a   solution of   this !-aL-.erial in
                   95-per  cent  alcohol in a    coiicentration o,    I
                   The solution is or2iginally light-bi-o@vn in        color., but
                   after a daar or two it becomes blue;.sh, as        if it ccntala,>,d
                   rr.ethylene blue.  Currently we are preparir,.o the solution
                   fresh on the @.iorning it is to be used.
                   We have now given as .nuch as 3 -Ig of            per 79 kg. of
                   body weight without oloserving any definite sutjeci'.Ive
                   effects.  There is a suggestioii (subject to proper
                   controls) that the following may be occurriiia:  drop in
                   diastolic blood pressure, in-.rcase in pulse rate, and
                   elevation in body te..nperature.   It is already apnarent
                   that C-5 orally will be far less pot.ent than C-9.
           2        I have not yet received the additional supPlY 0          f ',@-302,
                   or of the crude material.
                                                Yours very sincerely,
