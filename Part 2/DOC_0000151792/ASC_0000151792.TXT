           On 19 May 1961 1  had.a visit from Dr.'.-Glenn   Ullyot
           and Dts. Tedeschi and Loev of Smith Kline & French
           Laboratories, Philadelphia.
           These peodle have become  interested  in  the  therapeutic
           possibilities of drugs in the cannabinol c.,J-ouD and have
           synthesized a number of compounds, includinc- @he most Dot-@ent
    2       compound made by Loewe.  Copy of the information they    supplied
           me is enclosed.
           Naturally they are interested in the ma-LIerial termed
           SKF-5390., which is a -,nxtur-- of isomers and may not  be as
           potent as one of the materials studied by Loewe.
           So far the materials have been  studied  only  with  their
           screening methods and they  are  naturally  interested  in the
 2          resemblance of the efj'@ects to those of the phenothiazine
           tranquilizers.
           As yet they have not  done  detailed  toxicology,  general
           pharmacodynamics, netiropharmacology, or psycho-oha-macoloo-y
           on the material.  They are sending me a sample of SIC--5390
           and I will check it out for potency and for general pattern
           of effects.
                    7                 With kindest personal regards,
                                                     M#D,
