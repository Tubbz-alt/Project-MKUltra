             Ihave worked  the dose  of C-5 up to  loo mg./70  l(g.
             of body weight without  obtaining any appreciable
             subjective mental effects, or any ob-iective changes
             in behavior.  Cardiovascular  effects  of  the  degree
             seen with C-9 also have not been apparent.  The
             material has been given in alcoholic solution by
             mouth.
             It appears to me that this-is2 a relatively inert
             drug. Do you wish me to  take  the  dose  any  higher,
             or to discontinue study rJO it?
             I have to be in Washington  from  March  27th  through
             April 3rd and will have some free time on Monday,
             March 31st and on Tuesday  April  Ist.  I  could  come
             down for a visit If you so de-sire. -I-will give
             you a call while In Washington.
                           1                 Sincerely yours,
