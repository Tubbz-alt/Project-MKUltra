                I am enclosing-copy of   a  report ',Effect of Epinephrine on
           2     the LSD Reaction.    You will notice that we were unable to
                either accentuate or inhibit the LSD reaction by injection
                of o.4-o.6 mg. epinephrine /70 kg-. subcutaneously.  Taken
                tn.conjunction with.our failure to block'the mental effects
                of LSD with Dibenzyline, 1 feel that these data are a
                further indication that the'adenergic  hypothesis  of  the
                LSD reaction2 must be questioned rather strenuously.
                Prelimi.,iary assessment of four materials received  from
                the Sandoz Company has now been completed.  Three of the
                materials proved to be psychotomimetic agents, though
                weaker than LSD. The doses  approximately  ectiivalent  to
                i.0-1.5 mcg./kg. of LSD are:  LSM, 6-9 mcg*@.4-g.; DA.,vi-57.1
                10-15 mcg.7kg@; LPD-824, 10-15 ricg./kg.  A more extensive
                study of these three materials Is now underway.
                DLO-57 did not induce any  psychotomimetic  changes,  even
                in doses of  100 mcg./kg.  A further direct investigation
                of this particular  compound  is  therefore  being  dropped.
         2       Possibly, potential  cross-tolerance  between  It  and  LSD
                might be studied at some future date.
                I  am  enclosing  thermofaxconles  of  material  concern!ng
                o*,.rer LSD cok-6._@erars which have been'forwarded to me by the
                Sandoz Company.
                Please-let us 1,.now if there Is any way  in which  we  can
                assist you with your program.
