                     All post SI suggestions were again re-enforced to both and
                 suggestion was given that upon direction, subjects would awaken.

                 applied and a deep state of SI was again very sooif 2reached.  Again
                 induction and protective suggestions were re-enforced and the sub-
                 jects were awakened and excused shortly thereafter.
                      Partial ainnesi,-i was present.  Post SI suggestions were 100%
                 effective and both are considered good subjects for further research.
