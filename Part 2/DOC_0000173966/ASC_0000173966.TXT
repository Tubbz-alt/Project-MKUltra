                                                  I.  INTRODUCTION
                  En one of our previous reports, we described the morphology of the electric organ
                  Df Sternarchus all)ifroiis, a we,-d@ fresh water electric fish from South America.
                  We mentioned that the electric transmitting organ of Stei-narchus is derived from
                  nervous tissue and no2t from modified muscle tissue lilce the majority of other elec-
                  tric fishes.  This is mal@iiig Stcl-ii,-irchus different from other electric fishes: it
                  has a very 1-d-h sic
                              ID    ,q-lal r,-tte and the signal is phase and amplitude modulated.
                  The form, rate, and amplitude of the signals emitted by the el2ectric fishes are as
                  diverse as the forms and sizes of these fishes.  Some of the wealc signals are used
                  to locate- objects or animals in their environment, or for navigation, species recog-

                  quciicy close to tl-ic electrical signal en-Atted by Ei,-enmanilia.  When the applied
                  pulses came within + 3 to 4 pps of the one eii-iitt,-,d by Ei,-enmal-u-Aa, the fish would
                  chancre its rate by 4 to 5 pl)s in a direction 2xvliich increased tfie pps separation.  In-
                  creasing the frequency of the applied a-c current in 1 pps increments caused the
                  fish to shift its frequency correspondingly until it reached about 6 to 7 pps over its
                  normal rate, when it would rei,ert to its orizinal rate.  We obtained similar results
                  in c.%Wriments with Steni-,irclitis ill)ifrons, but the applied a-c signal was within 0. 5
                  cycle of the signal of the fish, clemonsti--,ttin- how specific the ,Lpplied signal must

                    The main objects of this study were  the  form,  innervation,  and  physiology  of  the
                    electi,oplates formin- the electric transmittin- organs.    The clecti oplates of.
                    Hypopomus, Gyliinottis carapo, M-,ilal:)tcrurus, and some Mormy-l-idae have the same
  2                  surface area and produce spil@:es durin- discharge.  The electroplates of Stenlopylrlus
                    and possibly Eigenm-.tnnia have tino peculiar characteristics: there is a steady po-
                    tential on which pulses are superimposed, and the resistance of the electroplates is
                    similar at the peak or between the spikes.  The electroplates are of the type with a
   2                 slow depolarization.
                    In IiL-popomtis, l@lal,,tpteriii-tis, ,tnd most or the Morm@Tidae, the inner,,,,ation of the
                    electric organs is through stalks.  The stall@.s may serve to amplit, depol.-Lrization
                    until it would be able to invade the body of the electioplates.
                    The disc2harge rate -,tnd duty cycle have been compared for electric fishes like
                    Stcrnol)y,ni  (rate = 50/sce) and Eigcnm-,iiinia (r-,ite = 286/sec) with the Stemarcllidae
                    (mo.%. 1500/sec).  Compared with mamm.-tli,-ui central nervous systems, peak- fre-

                  Sternopygus, and Ei-cnmamii.,t,,tre in the constant rate group; Electrophorus,
                  Gr,ithoneiiius potersii, Steatorron3rs, and I-Iipopomus belong to the variable rate
                                4
                  group. BemetL 2did not malze any connection  between  the  electric  fishes'  electrical
                  systems, their environment, and their belianior.  No one investigated their evolu-
                  tion, very little is known about their matin- or birthplace, and no one has reported
                  the broodiig of electric fishes confined in water tai@@.
                  Sternarchtis albifrons also has two kinds of e2lectroreceptors: tonic  and  phasic,  and
                  they are autorliythmic.  These electroteceptors are sensitive to movement and di-
                  rection.  The phasic electroreceptors seem to be related to informatioa regarding
                  movement of objects near or around the fish..
                  Acceptin- the principle of pacemaker activity in the brain, it seems that there are
                  only a reduced number of command nuclei acting  on  the  2electric  transmitting  organ.
                  It is also reasonable to assume that electrically mediated positive  feedback  must  be
                  present; chemically mediated transmission would be too slow  for  the  repetition  rate
                  of transmission which can attain under certain circumstances over 1, 300.
                  Alautlmer cells of lower vertebrates (Figure 1) can be considered single cells
                  2                                                                       8,9

                                                                                   t@-
                  and these cells thus constitute a bilateral command system for the depressor
                   2      10,11
                  muscles.      For e%-plaining the pacemakers action of the command nuclei in the brain
                  of the mormyrid electric fishes a mutual excitation with positive feedba-ci@: has  been
                  proposed. This theory would not work for  the  Mautluier  cells.  There  is  a  crossed
                  inhibition between the Mautlner cells in the brain of the goldfish and it could equally
              9    be effective in an electric or-an system.  There is a requirement of 1-d-h speed

                    mlnt for rapid communication between cells.  This mode of transmission also pro,.,es
      t             to be able to mediate many functions often considered as restricted to chemically
                    mediated t2ransmission.  The correlation between morphologically close apposition
                    and electrotonic couplina- was considerably strengthened by the work on electro-
                    motor systems.  This correlation helps to validate morphological identification of
                    electrical transmission in other systems where electrophysiological analysis is
                    not so simple,
                    It is not known whether there is any relevance 2to hicrher systems of the organizational
                    principles deduced from electric organ systems.  The next level of analysis of the
                    electric organ systems may be no easier than the study of less specialized systems
                    that are of more general interest. Some kmowledge is being obtained of afferent
                    pathways from electroreceptors in weakly electric fish which have important inputs
                    to 2the electric organ control system.  Both operant and respondent conditionin- of
                    the control system can b@ obtained and conditioned response latency can be very
                    short. It is not unreasonable that the complete neural pathway of the conditioned
                    response could be obt,-ined in these cases.  The central connections are still
                    minimally explored; one knows what -oes in and one can go from 2the electric or,-an
                    SCI,eral synapses mitidromically.  The rewards for fillin- in the gap would be great,
                    and prospects for at least some pro-ress are bri-ht.

                     receptors.
        2             As previously mentioned,     some  fresh  water  weak  electric  fishes  have  the  ability  of
                     perceivin,-
                                 objects, their movemenf and direction, and also to determine some char-
                     acteristics of tlicse objects (such as conductivity).  For tlds underwater pattern
                     recognition, they utilize  both  their  electric  transmittincr  organs  and  their  electro-
                     receivers.  Obviously  some  other  sensory  perception  receivers   of   the   lateraus   line
                     may be involved such  as:  free  neuromasts  and  the  ctipula  type  of  lateral  line  re-
                     ceivers; the auditi-%,e system  may  play  a  role  also  in  this  pattern  recognition.  Some
                     of the electric fishes are blind2 or  have  vestigial  eyes;  others  liaie  good  vision  and
                     it is certainly used in the reco,,m, iition process.
                     It seems that a  hybrid  system  made  of  a  diversity  of  sensory  receptors  is  used  by
                     the electric fishes to locate and  identify  objects  and  fishes  of  the  same  or  different
                     species and also  prey  or  predators.  They  use  little  elec2trical  energy  for  this  and

                     The recordings of the autorliytmic electric signals from electroreceptors need
                     special instrumentation.  The sigmals are of low voltages: less than 1 mv, and they
                     need a large band,.vidtli.  The diameters of some of the electroreceptors are of the
                     order of microns.  There is the need for an insulate2d microelectrode with a tip of
                     one micron, with a reasonable low resistance, possibly less than one megohm,
                     responding from DC to several 1,.Hz with low distortion and enough rugged to with-
                     stand some bumpin- by the fish.  It has also to be of a nonpolarizable type. We
                     developed a microelectrode with all these characteristics and it is described later
                     in this chapter

               to hold the temperature constant during experiments. For the experin-lents, the

               same water ,Nas used for nii@dii- in the anaestlictics.  In this way, the temperature
               of the water and anaestlietic solution was easy to keep to the same level as the normal
               temperature of the water in the aquarium.  The pH of the aquarium water -,it the be-
               ginnin,,,r of tl-le experiments and also the pH of the -maestlietic solution were measured
               with an ex-paiided precision type of pH meter.  The pH meter has been calibrated
               before each e%-periment.

               anaestlictic has been marlred,%vith the aid of a timer and also recorded on the magnetic
               tape and in our records. T2he effect of the anaesthetic  on  the  fish,  its  behavior  and
               reSpirELtion were constantly observed.  The  electric  activity  has  been  monitored  and
               from time to time a photo has been tal@;,en from the oscilloscope.  The moment in
               which the  fish  was  anaesthetized  completely  has  been  recorded.  The  fish  respira-

               aquarium water has been  introduced  in  the  experimeatal  tray  with  adequate  aeration
               for the fish. This moment has been  recorded  and  the  recovery  time  of  the  fish  has
               been marl@ied.  The electric activity also has been monitored.. When the fish was
               considered  completely  recovered,  it  was  returned  to2  its  own  aquarium.   Sometimes

          From seven anaestlictic agents we tried, six  were  inadequate  because  the  repetition
           ate of the electric signal was affected. Only the thi  ental  sodium  Abbot  (pentothal

           sodium) does not influelice the electric activity of Sternarclius albifrons.
           The tliiopental sodium has been checke2d on five different  fishes  (same  species).  It
           has a very fast effect in a dosage of 1:10000 in,%vater.  The fish, after it has been
           a=sthetized, %@ould remain ,is such for 2 to 4 hours lyin-  very  quietly.  It  recovers
           completely and the anaesthetic has no ill effect on tl-le fish. We  anaesthetized  them
           repeatedly and after six months' time they are doing wel2l.  After  the  fish  has  been
            amestlietiz,ed, it has to be put in aerated fresh water where it can remain for  hours.
            Figures 23, 24, 25 and ;6 show that the repetition rate of the electric signal has
            not been affected in over 40 n-dnutes. The only cl=,-,e was produced by  a  slight  de-
            crease in water temperature (from 720 pulses to 700 pulses) of al-)out 0. 4 C.
          2  Sternarchus albifrois is very sensitive to chan-es in water temperature. It will
            increase the repetition rate of the electric signal for an increase in wate7r temperature
            and it will dccroase the repetition rate for -. decrease  in  water  temperature.  For
             every degree Centi--rade, it may chaii-e the repetition rate by about 50 to  80,  de-

                                IV.  TECHNICAL DISCUSSION
        Four specimens of Stcrnirchtis -,tll)ifrons have been used for esltblisliin-  methods  to
        record the autorhythiiiie activity of their clectroreceptors (Figures 29, 30).  The
        r,shes hane to be an,,testlictized and cul-arized in order to avoid twitching of the muscles
        during microc2lectro(le recordings.  We tried the effects of d-tubocurarine on
                                                42
        stl,rnarchus ilbif i-oiis.. Ha,,-,iwara, et al , recommended 0. 05 to 0. 1 m- curare/fish
                            43
        and Enger and Szal)o   recommended 0. 03 mg d-tubocurarine/,-, fresh fish weight.
        I3,Dth used (,@IS 2222) tricaine methanesulfonate for anaesthesia (1:150, 000).  We  folmd
        that the quantities given did not correspond in our case.
        The weiaht of the Stei-narchus specimens varied between 16 g an@d 19 g.    One specimen
        (16 9) recei-,,ed 0. 5 m- d-tubocurarine intra-abdominally. The  fish  was  paralyzed  in
        one minute. Electrical acti,,,ity of the main electric organ subsided  after  20  minutes
        and the fish was dead after another ten minutes. All the time the fish  was  kept  in  a
        4000 ml beaker with medicated aquarium water at a pH  of  7.  0  and  a  temperature  of
        23.OOC. An aerator stone provided the necessary air.
        A second specimen of Sternarchus (also 16 g) has been anaestlietized with MS 222,
        1:25,000. one gram of MS 222 has been dissol2ved in 1000 ml distilled H    2 0 as
                              'his was diluated to the proper amoun in
                                                                     t    a 4000 ml be.-tker  by
        stock solution.  Then t
        adding P-quariuni water with merbromine and acriflavine added as disinfectants.
        The MS 222 dilution of 1:150, 000 would not affect the fish in over one hour.  The
        dilution of t2he '@IS 222 was reduced to 1:25, 000. After 20 minutes in the MS 222
        solution the fish was injected intra-,.ibdominally with 0. 05 mr of d-tubocurarine
        I mil solution.  The fish was paralyzeci in three minutes.  For one hour it gave a good
        stron- electric si,-m                                          r

         stained with Hem,-ito.Vlin-Eosin and mount@--d with Per2moiLmt on iTAcroslicles.  There
         are about 27 microslides with four to five serially cut transversal slices numb,-.red

      thin the body muscle as in all the other electric fishes.  The electric or,-,-Ln, depend-
        on the fish's size, forms a sheath from 2 to 10 mm or even tl-dckcr, in which the
      ,cti,oplatcs are st.,tel@ed in the longitudinal direction arranged in a somehow non-
      -larly fashion, contrary to the oilicr electric fishes.  The electroplates are disks
      about 1 mm diameter and 20 to 40 microiis tliicl,3ioss and derived from myeloblasts.
      the center of the c-.itidal face of each electrol)late, a thin stalk arisesfrom a complex
      agiiiation. The end of this stalk makes contact Nvitli the branches of a single myclinated
      -ve iner arisiii- frou-i a large ncrne cell situated 2in the gray matter of the spinal cord
      ween the levels of the first mid second spinal nerve roots. As it can be seen on
      -ure 51, the nerve ti-ui-Ic which is heavily myclin-ated is- easily identified.  The way
      ,,Iiich tiie electric or--.m is innervated plays an important role in the synchronization
         dsm of the discharge.
        'i@lal,,tpterur2idie discharge consists of a long train of 15 to 30 monol)hasic pulses
        to 2 msec duration in a total time-internal of appro.-dmately 100 milliseconds.
        '.x to seven inch electric catfish could discharge impulses of approximately 200 V.

        It Aquarium in S,,ui Francisco, told me that the 2two very large (appro.,dnutely 2 to

        (tail to head) by decreasing the rate of impulses.  Other electroreceptors will react
        to higher or lower conductivity than the medium (.iquarium water) in a similar way.
        Obviously, the response of the electroreceptors in other electric fish species  have  to
        be assessed in order to get a better overall picture of the underwater pattern  recogni-
        tion process.  Figures 57 tlirougli 63 show two d2ifferent electroreceptors of electric
        fish. The results obtained from the electric receptors study will lead to  a  simulation
        plan of an underwater pattern recognition system. A passive hybrid underwater pattern
        recognition system bloclc diagram is shown in Figure 64. In this bloclc  diagram  beside
        the electric sensory receptors, the other types of lateralis line sensory receptors  are
        combined to obtain a better cr2oss-correlation of the different signals.  Eventually
        passive optical sensory receptors will be added (for detectin-, for example, changes
        in the bioluminescent organisms in the water when disturbed by a stimulus lilce heat,
        ivater turbulence, etc.).
        With regard to the other lateralis line organs, Sternarchus albif-rons, like other teleosts,
        have canal orcans as well as superficial organs, called  fre2e  neuromasts.  Some  parti-

    2     not been -is yet innrestigat@ed in a detailed way.  The connections bet%@een the electro-
         aptors, the different nerves, nerve-trtmks and the brain have to be investigated.  In
         way, their iiiterrel.-itionship could be established.  Microolectrode recordings from
         electroreceivqrs  proper  and  from  their  nerve  fibers  have  been  planned.   Electro-
         ;ect2ion and clearing of the lateral line near the  electr'oreceptors  to  be  investigated
         enable us to record from the efferent nerve fibers.
