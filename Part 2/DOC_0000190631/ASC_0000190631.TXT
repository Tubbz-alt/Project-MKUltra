                             Since this was in a sense still an exploratory operation    all
                      subjqcts were tested on hand levitation.  As a rule this was2 not too
                      successful.
                             Tlierea-fter, all subjects were run by various operators on a
                      slow,, straight induction and awakening.
                             j@fter a poi,iod of discussion, the          ,-iVe. gain run on a
                      slow induction method with the exceut,ion  Oi'             W 0 was not

                             In general, this session was not too successful in the opinion
                      of the writer and there-vsre @oo mahy people working in too small an
                      area which produced tinu.-uq-1 curiosity and a cert,-tin amount of
                      corLLugion in carrying out instructions.  In addition, the inductiorr, as
                    4  a rule were run too slowly with a great deil of wasted talk and motion
                      and far too much explanation to be productive of good results.
