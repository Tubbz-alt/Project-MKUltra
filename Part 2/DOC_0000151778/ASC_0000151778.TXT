            TITLE OF PROTECT:      Addiction Liabilities of Synthetic Substitutes for
                                    Codeine.
                 Objectives:  To find a synthetic analgesic and anutussive drug which
            would be as safe as codeine with regard to tomcity and addiction liability.
            ABSTRACT (OR SULU,,,@.Y) OF RESULTS:
 2                a.  Since start of Droject: Sd@a annual re-corts for 1952 through 1958.
                 b.  Durincr the curre,.it re-oortincr- Period:
                     Continued from the period covered by Annual P.-ogress Report
            for I November 1957,-l November 1958, were the following investiga-tions:
                 1.  d Methadone.  The results of studies on this drug indicate that
            alt2hough it possesses low abuse lia:oility, it can produce toxic effects on
            chronic administration in high doses.  At non-toxic dose levels it may be
            useful as a su@z)stitute for codeine as an antidiarrheal agent.  I's analgesic
            potency kopears to be very low, wb-Ue its antitussive activity has no%-, been
            investigated adequately.
                 2.  1-(3-Di-ohenyl-3-carbo0nitril-pro-o771)-4 -Dhenvl-4 carbethox7-
            T)I-peridine (R-1132, Dioheno.@-,Vlate). Further studies revealed that while
            subcutaneous doses of 10-50 mg did not produce significant effects in
            postaddicts, intravenous doses in this range did produce definite morphine-
            like changes in behavior.  These observations, as well as the results of

             "direct addiction" studies confirm the o-Dinion previously ex-oressed, that
             this compound does possess addictive properties, but the order of it,-
             abuse liability Is somewhat less than that of codeine.  It is anticipated
             that R-1132 will be marketed in the near future as an araddiarrheal agent.
                  3.  Metabolism of i,Tor--rnor2t)h.i.n.--n. Furthe.- studies were made to
             determine the nature o@ the conj-Lg,,,.ted form of urinarj normorp-bine.
             Ff-n-sults thus far i.?i-dicat,"@,,@hat this form is not a gli-leuronide nor a..'l
             ethereal sulfate.
                      Studies on postaddicts were completed on nine ne,2-,z compounds.
             Of these, seven were found to rossess abuse liability comparable to that
             of morphine, and therefore to be unsuitable as substitutes for codeine.
                  1.      3-Hydrox7,-;-N-phenac,7@lmorDb-in-,,.-i met.',,@ne sulfo.,i-ate (1,4-IH-75IL5,
             LevoT)henacylmorphan)2. The eu-,o.',-iorogenic and morphine aostinence-
             suppressing potency of this compound is about ten times that of morphine,
             though the intensiiy @of the abstinence syndrome in "direct addiction" studies
             was somewhat less.
                                                                                        -31

             EBr (iNM-7Zl9, Phenazociiie).  Euphoria, equivalent to 20-30 mg of
             morphine (subcut'aneously) is produced by 3-4 mg of this dx-@g by t.@ie same
             route.  With respect to supt)ression of morpliine-a7z>slinence phenomena,
             1 mg of this compound is equivalent to 8. 1 mg of morphine (in strikirg
             contrast to r-asultz@ obtained by others in the monkey, which indicated thp-t
             it was only one-sixth as potent as morphine in this regard), though the
             intensity of the abstinence syndrome in "dire.--t addiction" studiesvras
             s,omewhat less than tliat of morphine.2

             la@,e ethane @-z@onate (NIH-75--'O).  In doses of 15-9-0 mg this drug produces
             euphoria equivalent to 20-30 mg of morphine, and is about twice as potent
             as morphine in sup ressincr morp2hine-absU.-.ence phenomena.

             dazole (ITI-H-7586). In oral doses of 100 rn-a this drug produces euph-ori.-o.
             and 2.62 mg are equivalent to I mg of morphine in suppressing mor7phine-
             abstine,,ice phenomena.

             dazole methane sulfonati-, (ZTIH-7607).  On oral administration this
             compound is 80-120 times  as  potert  as  morphine  in  eup.qorogenic  potency,
             and about 60 times as effective as morphine in suppressing2 morphine-
             abstinence pher-c@'mena.  After "direct addiction" to this drug, the inte.,isity
             of the abstinence syndron;,-5 is comparable to that, of morphine.

             The potency of this drug) with respect both to its euphoroge2nic and
             morphine abstinence-suppressing activity,     is comparable to that of morpi@ir,,,,.
                  7. N-(2-E(Meth7l)-phenet@h7la-mino,3--oro-o7l)--oL-o-oioanUide (LNM. 1- 7 ri @O 3
             Diam-oromid . TIL-LougIf'its duration of action is much @hort--r (two to  thrae
             hours), this compound 5produces euphoria in doses of 75 mg subcutaneously
             equivalent to Lliat of 20 mg of morphine, @nd at daily dose levels  of  625  or
             750 mg (in four divided doses per day),, it substitutes adequately for morphine
             in suppressing morphina.-a@bstinence phenomena, for the relatively short
             period of Its action.

                Two other new compounds proved to have considerably less abuse-
             liability than morphine:
                 1.  D-3-@i,)Ietho@w-N--ohenethylmorph,:nan (=-7296A).  This
             compound was inveq-tigated for theoretical reasons.  In singld doses on
             oral administration, up to 1, 000 n:@q did not produce eu-Dhoria consistently,
             though 3 of 4 subjects rerorted mo=hine-like effects while receiving 500 mcj
             four times daily.  It app,-z'ars to be aboli@6 1/25th as potent as morphine in
             sup.Dre---sing morphine-absunence phenomena, and in "direct addiction"
             studies at daily dose levels equivalent to-48 n-ig of morphine, no abstinence
             phenomena were obse2rved.  T@owever,, there is no evidence at pre-sent that
             this compound will be useful clinically.
                 2.  N-(l-Methvl-2--oi-o--ridinoethyl)-pro-oloanilide . Ecl (iN=-7602.
             Phenam-oromid). In single doses subcutaneously, this compound produces
             definite morphine-lil-ce effects, and at daily dose levels of 1135 r,-)g (in three
     2        equally divided doses per day), it suppresses morphino-abst,.nence
             phenomena partially.  However, at such levels, disturbing side-effects
             occurred which were compared by the subjects to those of d-lysergic acid
             diethylamide (LSD-25), cocaine or marihuana.  For this reason, and
             also because it does possess definite abuse liability, it is not I i kely th,,-,t
    5         this compound will prove to be an adequ%te substitute for codeine.

                  Currently under ini7estigation are three other nev-i compounds differin-
             basically in chemical structure from both the opiate derivatives and
             synthetic analgesics studied heretofore.  1-tp-Chlor-phenethyl)-2-m--t2hyl-
             6, 7-dimetb-oxy-l, 2,3, 4-tetrahydro-isoquiroUne Hcl (.L\TM-7672A) has been
             found in preliminary clinical trials elsewhere to exm-rt analuesic effects in
             MaLl compar,;-,bl-- to thoseol cod@,-iiib, and in mon?,.-ys it does not  suppresz-)
             morphine-a:.os,6in2ence phenomena.  2-(Beta-hydroxy-_ohenethyla=iino)-pyridl:--ie
              Hel  (Phenyrarnidol)   a-:id   N-Isopropy-1-2-meL'iyl-2-propyl-1,   3-propanediol
             dicarbamate (@arisoprodol) are currently martc--t,--d as "rauscle rela.-,-antslt
             (ascrib,-od to internuncial blo%--tdng a2&,ivity) and are said to reliev,-n  certain
             types of pain.  At present the data obt-ained in addictive studies on pos-L-
             addicts are insufficient to warrari,4, rt-ateme-.,its a:oout their ecouse li;a:buities.
                 In addition, studies of a basic m(athodolocn-cal nature were made during
             the period of 2the present report to improve staridards of comr)arison of
             abus,-, liability of new compounds primarily L-i,@.ended for oral admL-li---t.-at,.on
             with that of morphine.  The results indicate           respect to suppr.-ssion
             of morphine abstinence phenomena, 1 mg of morphine qubcutaneously is
             equivale,.7it to 2.86 mg of morphine orally, 14. 7 mg of codeine orally,  and
             35 mg of d-propoxyohene orally.
