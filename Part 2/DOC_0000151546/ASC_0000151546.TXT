                         Mr. Cunningham in Anslinger's office, since @,ilr. Cunninghar,@n      is

                              3.  Dr. Isbell provided,=e with one grarr. of 1-6ro.-neran
                         tartrate and 0. 5 grains of2 the Dhenett@vl derivative.  ',he phenathvl
                         derivative is -5 time's more po#.ent than 1-dromeran but in all other
                         ways is strictly comparable in iis action.  it is the most pote-nt
                         of all morphire derivatives b,-,r far.  Dr. Isbeli his no doubt of
                         its oral potencv but is testincr @i. Th:e ralio of intra-@nuscular 4@-.o
                         oral potepcy is est'iniated to be 1. 5 to 1.  This par'%.icular substance

                      produces  a rather acute.toxic psychosis of two to three dayst
                      duration,  More information will be available on this compound
                      later.
                           6.  I queried Dr. Isbell on the
                                                             possible use of orinase to
                      potentiate and/or pr2olong the LSD reaction (based on information
                      that orinase lowers the capacity of the liver to perform its normal
                      detoxifying function).  He felt that a considerable amount of i,-iforn,,a-
                      tion could be gotten about the feasibility of this through some animal
                      work with the.compound prior to his human work.  He suggested
                      use of Dr. Winter's technique.  If the animal work indica2tes that
                      this is a feasible approach, he will be very glad to do the human
                      work with the material.
                          7.  Dr. Isbell is viery interested in testing- the French com-
                      pound it we can furnish- him with *j'-,e substance and some animal
                      data. His inleiest in t-he  compourl'd comes from its possible con-
                      nection with the active,compounds found :i-n nutmeg, etc.
                          8.  In connection with the problem    of cliecking the effects of
                      druas on suggestibilitv                           ndard procedure
                                           @ . Dr. Isbell felt@ that a sta '
                      .could be Worked out which would not necessari y require the use of
                      a hypnotist.  The technique he suggests consists of the productio2n
                      of a standard tape recording,@;,hich su,,Tgests that a person. is sway-
                      ing on Iiis feet.  The subject is olaced in a sway meter.  There
                      his tendencv for normal swavi.ng and swaying under stiggestion
                      will be measured at different time,-z 4.,-, order to determine rer)rm-

                                 9.   D.-. Isbell suggest,?d that the    problem of an anti-
