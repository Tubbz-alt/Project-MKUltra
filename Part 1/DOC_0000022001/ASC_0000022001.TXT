                              A survey was made of a variety of sources dealing with learning

                           +.raini-ng has been uncovered in our survey.  Verbal learning, as
                           comnor-ly und@rstood, does not occur during ac@@UaLl sleep.  Althougb
                           some verbal learning can occur during lov levels of irakafulness,
        7                   such as drowsin2ss or reverie, there is no acqu--sition of sueb

                                          A Sum-ary Fzview of "Sleep L@zLrning"

                         Problem
                             The claim that knowledge can be acquirad iiitbout effort  is  the
                         pr=ise -of sleep lea2rn'Alng. The purpose of the prc-sent paper is  to
                         assess this claim vith particular reference to the lcarning of
                         foreign languagas.
                         I)efiniti,on of "Sleep L,-tarnin.%"
                             The term "Sleep Lep-rning," as used in the present  paper,  refers
                         to the leaming, or supposed learning, of so2me verbal subject matter
                         or skill during a state of natxu-al sleep. That this  is  the  co-  a
                         meaning of the term is apparent from a revieu of populalr @nd commereigll
                         sources, as well as from the sciantiric llteraturz,  both  of  which
                         are listed in the tablt of references on page 11.
                     2        The references mentioned ind.,Lcate a geners-I and co=on  meaning
                         to the term "Sleep Learning." Other similar terms are "sleep
                         education" and "sleep teacbing."  The sleep learning idea is
                         sometimes associated with h@,pnotism, as in  "hypnor)edia."  So=eti=es
                         sleab learning is assoc2iatad with therapy, as in  ':sleep  therapy."
                         Ilhese meanings and usages apparently occur on a w4-da basis,  being
                         found in both Zuropean and Western literatures.
                             The fact of widaspread agreeirent as to the meaning o@@ the  term,
                         however, is no necessary reason for believing  that  sleep  learning
                         actually occurs. In order to te6st whetber  sleep  isarning  does  take

                         place, some objectiv@ft criterion of decidiri3 wbetber a person Is or
                         is not asleep, as well as wbetber th- person baz or has not learned
                         anything ubile in the sl.%3ping state must be utilized.
                           Although there are technical reasons for regarding  both sleep
              2           and learuing as continuoiis pben=ena sucb that one speak  of levels
                         in the sleep-wakafuuess continuum or of        in the simple-to-
                         complex learning continuum, it is also true that reliable judgments
                         can be made as to whether a -person is or is not asleep and,
                         Independently, as to v@et2her a person has or has not learn%d iomething.
                         Criterion oL§Iee2

                         person, in a sl@aping condi-tion,                  to ag@j4
                         as to wbetber be is or is not asleep at any one moment,: the absence
                       2  of alpha wave is co=oaly taken to indicate loss of consciousness or
                         onset of act-tia-1 sleep; presence of delta ,mvs indicates deep sleep.
                         Though other indicators of sleep are also used, the alpha and delta
                         wave riteria are in good standing.  (16, 19, 20)
                         Criterion of Learnin!i
               2             Learning, or the acq@-visition of knoiledge, is  commonly  demnstrated
                         by a variety oC questioning or testing procedures.  If a person did
                         not kncn the ansaier to a question yesterday and k--,ms it today, -this
                         is ganerauy taken as indicating be learned the answer  in  the  meantime.
                         Learning is genera3lly inferred on the basis o,@ an increase in  knowledge
                         or an improvement in performance attributad to  experience,  instruction,
                         study, or practice.

                          Purpose of Paper
                             This paper is concerned with the practical proble-m of assessing
                          the cont:-Ibution of sleep learning to the languag-- teaching process.
                          The major contribution to this assessment problem comes from a series
                          of studie2s @y Cbarles W. Simon and tlil]4am E. C:=ns.  These author$
                          systematically rev-ieved the sliep learning literature for the RA.ND
                          Corporation some years ago.  Their laboratory controlled, yet 'nighly,
                          practical, experiments on sleep learning &re i;idely accepted as the
                          most autho2ritative &nd definitive work that has been  done  on  the
                          proble.m of verbal or "comple.-." learning during sleep. The  major
                          failina of studies whieb purport to de=nstrat.- "s.leep learning" is the
                          use of an inadecluate or casual method of detarmifting when the learner
                          was asleep.
    2                         In view of this c=on fault, the technically sophisticated work
                          of Simon and Zm=ns warrants the folloi;ing detai..led  exp-Ucation.
                          The Simon and lmmns i.,,Deriments
                              In order to datermina, whether knowledge could be acquired during
                          sleep, Simon and Zm2=ns (18) played ganeral informp-tion question-and-
                          answar items one by one at five-minute intervals thraughout the nigbt
                          to 21 people.  There ware 96 questions in all, and eaeb question was
                          played to each person in the exp3rimental group one time.  By also
                          Lzeasaring the deptb of 112e3p of eaeb subject con@@inuously  during
                          the night by means ofthe 7@EG, it was possible to determine whether
                          a pers3n had learned the answer to a particular item-wbile be was

                            the arount learned by the experimental "sleep -earning" group was
                            prov-ided by a matched control group of 64 paop'-* wbo received no
                            intervening training on the items.  It vias fo2und that the greatest
                            learning occurred when the subject was wide awakaj that less and
                            less material was learned as the people became drewsier and drowsier,
                            and that when the people became really asleep, a@U learning stopped,
                            th-- level ot knowledge then being no higher than the knowledge bazeline
                            of the control paople.who had received no training.  As obown in the
                            graph on Page T, the clisar,-,earanca of all 12ar@3ing -with the onset of
                            actual sleep is c@.ear-cat.  The aixtbors concluied that "the results
                            support, tLe           that learning2 C i -.ng s2,eap is unlikely."
                                in the study just d,@scribed, each p@trson i-q the sleep-trained
                            grou? was exposed to each question-and-answer combination once and
                            only once.  A second experiment (6) was pert'or:ned to determine  -
                            whe2t.aer sleep 1earning would occur if the people bad co=non one-
                            syllable words played to them over and over again many times during
                            actual sleep.  By giving the people many axposl:,res to the items, a
                            greater opportunity was provided for sleep leaxni-ng to man-' 4"--st-
                            itself.  The number of times the items were pr@-sent!d during actual
                            sleep varied from 16 times for somz people to as many as 82 ti--es
                            for others, the averaga for the group bzing 46 pres,-ntations.  Aga-in,
                            no learning occurrad during periods when the '7,ZG indicated that the

                               probably no study of a complicated probleta can arrive at-
                             cotelusive proofs.  In this vein, Simon and Bmwis (18) state,

                             permit someone to learn complex material wh-i-la b2-a sleeps, but for
                             the 'present, sleep-learning is not the simple matter that some
                             experimenters and co=2rcia-I firms, vbich sell equipment for this

                               There is evidence that simple conditione2d reflexes can be
                             insti-.uted during sleep in animals and, presumably, in man. (I,       9)
                             Thus, sleep learning can legitijmtely  be'defend2d  in  a  technical  or
                             laboratory sense) though not in a practical  or  reELI-3-ife  sense.  It
                             would be misleading to interpret r:uch data cfut -of con2tot@ct in an

                                if learning during real sleep is impossible, a-nd if one's entire
                             wide-awake schedule is filled vtth active work  or  stlidy,  what  about
                             the periods in bet,4ee2n? Could the reverie  or  drcwsy  states  be  used
                             to acquire additional knowledge?
                                 Learning during the clrm;sy state  is  certai--ily  possible.  Simon
                             end 7-@mmons point out that "approximtely 3CKp; of the --- materia3.

                            conditions, as is t@,pically the situation in learning a foreign
                            language, the attempt to acquire knowledge during the  drcrisy  state
                            vould seem inefficient and u=eceseary-.
                                Some people so skillfully mamge their liv--s emd sebel'.ule their
                            time that tb2y work more hours per day than the average person, yet
                            also obtain adequate amounts of relaxation and sleep.  Other things
                            being equal, a person who works more bours per  day  will  accomplish
                            more in his total career than viU someone wbo works less.  The
                            number of hours per day iihich students work whi-l@i acquiring a foreign
                            language ranges from very few to very many, depending upon a boat of
                            persoma and situational variables.
                                At the present time, som,-- schools encourage students to  listen
                            to foreign lan6,@4%a material via tape recorder iibenever they are able.
                            Some students     liste2n to foreign language recordings while sbavi-ng,
                            or,wbile driving to work, or while getting ready to  retire  for  the
                            night.. Beyond s=e point, bowever, evea the most steadfastly
                            moti-.rated students vrill suc..umb to too much work and too much listening:
                            they may take vei-y ob2vious and direct steps to avoid the sound, such
                            as turning the machine off, or they may simply fall asleep and ignore it.
                            Such ifteidental learning has much to commend it and Is frequently
                            utilized without ill effects by students and educators.
                                However, none of the considerations listed abova are of such
                            importance as 3to 5mpair tba validity of the major conclusion reached
                            by this review: verbal learning, as co=only utid,-rstood, does not
                            occur during actual sleap.
