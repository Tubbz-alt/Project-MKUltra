                Bjol,,OD is an operational system  specifically  desi&ned  to  make  it
          .Convenient for unsophisticated couiputer users to study models of dy-
            namic systems.  The system features a high degree of interaction,
            user-oriented model-definition languages, and flerible, in-dep2th model
            structuring.  It employs a graphics console comprising a television
            screen, a data tablet, and a keyboard.
                A BIO'@IOD user may represent a model by drawing block diagrams
            and handprinting or typing text;  he  receives  iumiediate  feedback  about
            the system's interpretation of iiis actions.  Each component of a model
            block diagram may be defined by another block diagram; this facilitates
            2organizing models into meaningful substructures.  A user ultimately
            defines each co-,Pponent  block  by  analog-computer-like  elements,  alge-
            braic, differential, or chemical equations, and/or Fortran statements.
            A modeler may.thus define  his  model  in  whatever  terminology  is  mean-
            ingful to him.  Displayed curves are continually and automatically
            updated during model sit:,ulation. A  user  may  stop  2the  simulation  and
            plot different variables, c@ange scales, or alter parameter values,
            and then either continue  simulating  or  revise  the  description  of  his
            model.
                 This report demonstrates BIOIIOD  by  presenting  a  scenario  of  how
            a user might describe and simulate a dru--effect model, briefly de-
            scribes the system implementation, and discusses experience with users.

                  liedications and their prescribed dosages are designed to maintain
               a critical amount of drug in the blood for a specified period of time.
               The conventional method for determining optimal dosages involves numer-
               ous laboratory experiments.  If the drug effects carr be modeled, how-
     2          ever, a more efeicient'method is to  experiment  by  running  computer
               simulations.
                  One technique for niaint:aining the prescribed amount of drug is to
               use a,r-apsule containing a large number of differently coated pellets.
               The pellets dissolve-at different times, so that, as drug leaves the
               blood, it is replaced by drug released  by  newly  dissolved  pellets.
               Garrett 2and Lambert (8] have proposed  the  following  model  to  descIribe
               this situation.  A capsule comprises a number of pellet populations
               with different mean times of release.  The  rate  of  drug  release  for
               each population is assumed to be normally distributed (;.,,ith the same
               standard deviation for each population) about  the  mean  time  of  release
               for that population. The rate of addin2g  drug  to  the  body  is  therefore
               specified by a sum of  normal  distributions.  The  transfer  of  drug
               through the body is described by

                     dot displayed in the  corresponding  location  on  the  television  screen.
                     BIO!@IOD's interpretation of user pen a2ctions depends  on  where  the  pen
                     is placed and on what is currently displayed  on  the  screen.  I-le  may
                     hindprint characters in most  areas.  As  we  write,  a  displayed  "ink"
                     track appears to flow from the pen;  each  time  we  complete  a  character,
                     its track is replaced by a stylized  character.  We  can  change  a  cliar-
                     acter by writing another over  it.2  Some  symbols  are  used  for  editing;
                     for example, we may use a carat to insert  text,  or  we  may  scrub  with
                     the pen to delete text.  Some areas displayed on the screen act as
                     pushbuttons; if we "push" one of these  (by  touching  the  pen  down),  the
                     system performs the indicated  action.  If  we  push  a  displayed  arrow,
                     a continuous action takes place, such as the rescaling of a se2t of
                     curves. Some figures can be "dragged";  if  we  "touch"  one  of  these  and
                     move the :)en, the displayed  figure  follows.the  pen's  motion.  We  may
                     type (witi the keyboard) in  any  area  where  wricing  is  possible.  The
                     keyboard cursor may be positioned either with  r-he  pen  or  with  keyboard
                     control keys.
                     iI   To create our model, we e2nter  our  identification,  name  our  -iodal
                     DRUGS, then begin constructing  the  model.  Because  it  has  two  major
                     vmponents, we first draw  two  rectangles;  these  are  replaced  by  styl-
                     3.Zed'function boxes. We write CAPSULE in  one  box  and  names  of  parts
                     of the body in the other box, and tnen draw a flowline to connect them.
                     T'nis diagram (Fig. 2) pr2ovides n@t only a  picture  of  our  model,  but
                     also a means of defining the two co-,nponents  of  the  model  separately.
                          To define the capsule component,  we  first  push  the  DEFN  button
                     on its box. The system replaces the  block  diaaram  with  a  list  of  lan-
                     guages that we may choose  from  to  define  the  component.  The  languages
                     are block diagrams, mathematical  2equations,  cli-3mical  equations,  and
                     Fortran statements. t@a choose block di-,,,rains so t,iat we  can  define
                     the capsule as a set of  boxes,  each  representing  a  pellet  population.
                     This ability to define a box by another block  dia-ra,-i  enables  us  Eo

              This stat-ement (,4ith C for gain) indicates that the gain  of  DGI,  i.e.,.
              .the increased rate of change of DGI due to drug entering the body from
              outside, is equal to the sum of the rates of drug release  from  the  four
              pellet populations.
                 The model is no@4 defined except for  para=eter  values.  When  we
              indicate that we are ready to provide these values, BIO@'.OD dfsplays
              the names of model variables aiid parameters in two separate lists
              (Fig. 4). Names such as DGIQ indicate initial  values;  they  are  derived
              fro:a the chemical equations by BIO'@:-iOD.  We enter the values given or
              ir.plied by Garrett and Lambert.  We assume trat some drug is immediate2ly
              released into the gastrointestinal tract and therefore set DGIO to 5;
              the other drug amounts are initially zero.  In order to minimize storage
              requirements, BIO'.@'OD limits the number of variables whose values Are
              saved during simulation and the number of parameters whose values can
              be modified during simulation. Since  this,model  is  small,  we  indicate
              that we want to s2ave values of (and possibly plot) all the variables,
              and that we Eiight want to modify values of all parameters except PI.
                   It has taken us less than half an  hour  to'complately  describe  our
              model.  We no,,i indicate that we would like to simulate it.   BIO@'@OD
              first produces a CS@ir/360 (2] program that describes our  model  and pro-
              vides for gra0p@.ic display of the results.  CS@2, in turn, generates a

               central area are for specifying the y and x axes of the graphs.
                    We  expect  the  values  of  our  model  variables  to   change   smoothly   and
               over  several  units  to  TILME,  so  we  choose  a   simple   integration   method--
               Simpson's  method  with  step-size  =  0.1.  This  is   a   fixed   step-size   method,
 2              so   the   information   regarding   variable   step-sizes   disappears.    Before
               studying  how  to  use  a  multi-pellet  capsule,  we  want   to   ensure   proper
               model  behavior  Vien  there  is  initially  som3   drug   in   the   gastrointest-
               in-al  tract,  but  no  capsule.  To  eliminate  the  capsule  drug   we   push   the
               PARA@',ETERS  button  to  display  the  list  of  modifiable  parareters   in   the
               central area, then overwrite the value of DOSAGE, changing it to 0.
               Next  @@e  display  the  list  of  plottable  variables.  Because  %.!e  are  irost
               interested  in  the  amount  of  drug  in   the   gastrointesti-ial   tract,   blood,
               and urine, ,le drag the  names  D@'7I,  DB,  and  DU  to  the  y  axis,  We  want  to
               watch  the  Liodel  for  several  eirulated  hours,  so  we  chanoe  the  upper   range
               of TI'ZE (in  the  small  box  at  the  lower  right  of  the  central  area)  from  1.
               to 7.  We push PLEJT; now we are ready to plot DGI, DB, and DU fro-,i 0. to
               1. against TI'L'IE from 0. to 7. hours.
                    We  push  RESTART  and  the  simulation   begins   running.   We   see2   (from
               the curves) that DB, and later DU, are being generated-, the ",\'OW X
               number  changes  continuously  to   indicate   the   current   value   of   simulated
               TI@E.  Because  rGI  is  plotted  off  scale  along   the   upper   boundary,   we
               touch  the  pan  do@.-m  to  stop  the  simulation.  In  order  to  determine   the
               rance  of  DGI,  we  return  to  the  display0  that  lists  the   variables   along
               with their clrrent, riiinirritia, and T@ia-%iiaum values.  The  mcxiru-.i  value   of

                .slowly. i,,'e assume, from the Curvc-.,Is r(-Iasonable appearance (Fig.  6),
                that we described at least tlic- body co,-,iponc-rt of tlc model correctly,
                and our choice of integration Lietliod is adeq-,iite.   1..7c sce fron the
                curve labeled D3 that, as expected, the drug renia2ins in the blood for
                only a short time.
                    We reintro-luce  the  capsule  dru-  by  chan@ing  DOSAGE  back  to  3.,
                then restart the  sidiulation  and  @qatch  the  curves  being  continuously
                updated as it runs.  Once it becomes apparent that the capsule is not
                effective, i.e., that the value of DB drop"S too loii, we stop the simu-
                lation.  A2pparently (Fig. 7), the drug is not releasad from the pellets
                in time to replace the drug that leaves the blood.  To correct this,
                we change the u,.ean times of release from 2., 4., 6., and 8. to 1., 2.,
                3., and 4.  We then rerun the simulation and get much better resu        @ts.
                The amounl of drug  in  the  blood  should  be  greater  ,-han  2.52.  In  orIder
                to determine if this is achieved, we place the pen down in the cen'tral
                area to establish an x-y meter, then drag this meter to a place where
                Y (corresponding to DB-as well as DGI and DU) is eq,,:al to 2.5 (Fig. 8).
                Our choice of means was good, but they need to be adjusted to maximize
                the total  duration of capsule effectiveness.
                     While changing the means 'or2 further trials we realize that rather
                than controlling four means, we would prefer to dea-. only with the first
                v.san and the interval between mean times of release,  To reformulate
                the model in t'.Iis way, we return to its description and add another box
                to the definition of the capsule component.  In this box.we write
                                              M2 = '@'2ll + INTVAL
                and similar ecuations  for  M3  and  114.  This  replaces  the  parar,,eters
                @113, and M4 with the single parameter INTVAL, ,ihich we set to 1. and
                r.ar'K modifieble.  Once this is accomplished, we retranslate the model,
                then continue to  resit-,ulate  it  and  chang3  parameters  until  we  have
                est0ablished a satis'Lactory drug forTilUlation and adr,.inistration policy.
