                   A pr,'_rnary function of the skin is protection of the bodf.  One way in which it'
                   cloes this is b-f serving as a barrier to penetration of chemical s -- harrnf ul or
                   o,h,--r%vise2 -- .nto the body through its surface.  it is a formiciable barrier to
                   suc,a penetration.  For exarnple, the epidermis retards the diffusion of lovv

                  no c,.ridence in support of any of the theories, however. According to the
                  r'nosl widely held hypothesis, the molecules        \replace molecules of
                  bound water in the stratum corneurn.                   @bonds are less tight
                  Llian 1-30H - HOH bonds and, therefore, temporary dissociation, allowing
         2         chernicals to pass through, ;vould be easier. 7 In order           @ to allow
                  other substances to penetrate the stratum corneum. saturation of the inler-
                  molecular spaces may be necessary.  As               says, "it is almost as
                  if the pezietrant is conducted through the horny-layer barrier by remaining
                  .d.issolved in a continuous channel                    \-hich occupies inter-2
                  molecular spaces. " This "opening up" of a pathway t@rough the stratlu-n

                    molecular weight pass through more slowly, if at a-.1, and substances of high

                    penetration ;.nto the bloodstream.  Indeed, many of these substances, including-

                    reservoir.  Some, such as                       imay remain in 2the stratum
                    COrneurn for the most part.'

                        There are two main f.-,ctors to consider in the penet.-ration        through
                    the skin barrier -- the speed of penetration and the quantitative amount of
                    penetration.  Neither has been establ;,ghed with any degree of precision, but
                    -some figures are available.

                   I-le also said he found more psychori-iotor impairment in humans given
                   alcohol (or-.il'-y) and      (vla the skin) than woulcl be expected from
                   alcohol alone.  This interaclion sliotild be investigateci further            !is

                   Interactions between various drugs other than alcohol                 @should also
                   be investigated further.  One grokip of investigators found that
                   creased the t:3xicity (as reflected by a  change  in  the  LID 50)

                   Thus, there is a possibility              Icould facilitate the body's absorption of
                   drugs from sach sites as the gastrointestinal tract.  Such facilitated absorp-
                   tion could conceivably cause an otherwise safe dose o--' a drug to become a
                   serious or possibly fatal dose when given

                   have to be established by experimentation, using the specific chemical agents

                   interaction of alcohol               as well as any other drugs which potential

                   F'or use as a "carryingil agent for incapacitants,           Iwould have to be used
                   in  fairly  high  concentrations,  probably               To assure useful speed

                                        can fairly well be ruled out as a 2-nearis of quicl,, delivery
                     for psychatzopic agents, or any other agent with the internal organs as a
                     t.irget.  The chances are very goocl that any agent deliverf-,@l        would
                     not reach peak blood levels for several hours.  For a drug to be effective
                     quicl-ly (s2ay, reaching the blood in significant amou-.-,ts in five minutes) it
                     woltld have to be administeree as quite a large dose.  Thi5 is because, so
                     far as is kr-own, only a small percentage of the adrr@inistered dose will  reach
                     the circulation in that initial five minute period.
                     There are :oo many variables to be c@:rtain of the fraction of the delivered
    2                 dose which is likely to reach the target organ.  This is especially critical
                     for dosages of the psychotropic drugs.  Whether all the material ;ands on
                     the skin, hDw much remains in conta.ct with the skin, how calloused or
                     "tender" the subject'.s skin may be -- all may affec-- dosage and absorption.
                     Such possible factors as individual variation          @ll penetrabil2ity" and
                     possible insexisitivity to the "carried" agent also enter in. All these  factors
                     would tend to clirninate rnost "brain-active" agents from consideration be-
                     cause of their relatively low therapeutic ratio.
                     Incapacitation by somatic preoccupation  is  a  major  remaining  area.  Intense
                     itching or burning can be qtiite incapacitating.  Applied in the conventional
     2                manner, skin irritants such as itching powdr-,z z:an be removed by washing.
                          Icould cause the skin irritant to penetrate into the sk-kn, where a
                     reservoir could be formed. Once within the skin,  vvashin:y  and  rinsing  could
                     not remove them and might actually increase the irritation.  Several hours
                     of intense ;-tching or other irritation could ensue.  Quite3 possibly agents could
                     be found wiich wou'@d penetrate the stratum corneum and go no further,
                     eliminating the danger of overdosage which is such a distinct possiblity
                     when psychotropic agents are used.

                       One factor to be considered is the relatively
                                       For use at cool temperatures,  this  would  either  have  to  be
                       changed to a lower value by sorne means or               would have to be heated
                       prior to u;se.

                       that woulii break on contact after being thrown or fired from a gun.
                       The person who receives                                      lwould   be   aware
          2             of it.        itself has a noticeable odor, which could be masked with per-
                       fumes, bLLt probably not removed.,  Soon after adrninistration
                                      Ilocal reaction-i would appear --  burning,  itching,  and  the
                       like.  Finally, subjects would be aware of having ':Deen sprayed or squirted,

                       administered surreptitiously.
                       Ordinarily, when an individual is squirted or sprayed with a liquid, the asual
                       reaction :-s to wipe it off his skin.  Since the                       takes   a
                       finite time to penetrate -- several minutes at leaet      rnuch of the adminis-
                       tere,i ma--erial would probably be removed well before  i2t  had  any  time  to
                       penetrate.  This is a fairly strong argument agair-st applying
                               @i to exposed skin areas, although wiping  m-ay  have  sorne  effect  of
                       "rubbing  it in" and spreading it.
                       These objections cari be overcome by applying tile                           to
