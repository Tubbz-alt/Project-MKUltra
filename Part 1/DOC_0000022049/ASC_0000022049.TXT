           2                           Division. The  feasibility  for  remote  guidance  of
                   'animals in the free environment was demonstrated in 1965 using a
                        as the subject and an.                   as the auidance cue.  This
                     achievement prompted a rnore    intensive investi,,ation of other animal
                     species..  In the period 1966 to 19 6s,        guidance   system   waq

                     One of the more  notable achievements of the 2Lnimal studies was the
                     demonstration in 1968 that the homing behavior of                could be
