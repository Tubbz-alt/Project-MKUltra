                                      debatable.  In regard to this, we are not yet certain

                                      or very stupid but again this point is questionable.

                                  9    we, of course, have discussed this rwny times.
                                      Whether or not it can in fact be demonstrated we
                                      are  not sure and it is hoped that the field tests
                                      we are 'working on may help us along these'lines.
