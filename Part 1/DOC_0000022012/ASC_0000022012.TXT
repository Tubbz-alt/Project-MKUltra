                          it was found that of all the ki--ids of  pinnipeds, the  sea
                          lion (zalophus cal4-fornicus) and    the cor-mon barb8r  sea  (?:ioca

                          rejected because of apparent  lac%-  of  4-nte:lisence,  large  size,
                          or scarcity of the species.
                          Data on their kdilities indicate that Zalophus is superior to

                          because he is  usually  ke->t as a bouce pet while  Zaloohus
                          usually performs r tore exacting routines ift the cir--xm or zoo.

                             2               The fur seal (Callorhinus alascansus)

                             Thus, a 'seal' is either the sea lion (Za"@Ophus) that we see per-
                             forinint in the circus, or it is ti-.e corii-non ha:-bor seal (Phocida)

                          Cornea is flatish and serves well bot'i in water and air.

                          through the air  of   a stone 11, in diameter thrown 40 feet

                          bepause blind healthy seals have been ca*tured. No ducts to
                          remove tears to nasal passages, so eyes overalow with tears t:nat
                          run down their cheeks and may influence vision.

                          it should be noted that the seal exhales before diving and
                          calls upon a lo%ver heart rate (10 beats/ minute) and  oxygen

                          Seals seem to able to cor:@.municate and express the:7-selves
                          in terns sufficient to  establish  territorial  boundr4-es  and
                          to Indicate,pleasure. They can e-.nil-- a bark, click, or  roar
                          and have been able to "si.-ig" according to so2me experts. (See
                          section on bearin<r  for details on frequenc4@es of 'clic!4s').
                          They have a large range of vocal ability. Their 'singing'
                          has been recorded (see song below), and-history is ava4-lable-
                          of times when  seals were called and sing to by fisher--@an and

                          falling asleep,.
                          Ability for seals to olav musical instrv-nents indicates at
