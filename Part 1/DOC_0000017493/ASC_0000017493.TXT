                 Mr.

                       It has been one-year since the final payment of your grant In the omount-
                 of $9,50-,0.0-0. @ At that time, you had agreed to Provide a fi-- I report. --Subsequent
                                                                  no

                       As Is required -of non-profit-funding institutions Itote, I formally
                 relquest both an accounting of the funds received and the report agreed upon In our
                 initial ormr@gemei-its for the grant.
                       I feel that It Is fittin.9 for me to-emphosize that your delinquency in -reporting
                 may be detrirrental In that the Board of Directors and the scientific advisers of the
                 2C40tiety have been informed of your schedule for reporting III PrOVI,ovs rreetimgs and
                 must, of course, be given a progress report at our next mc-oting sched led for early
                 November. I would urge you to-consfder the-consequences of further delay.
                                                     Sincerely yours,
