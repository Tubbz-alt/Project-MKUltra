                    The parpose of this 14emorandiLm of Agreement is to set forth the
               mutual administrative responsibil2ities of-the principal research in-
               vestigator and the sponsor.-- Therefore, it-is-matually agreed  that,
                    A.- The principal investigator shall submit to the  sponsor,  at
               six month intervals, an inbrmal statement of expenditui-es of  monies
               advanced for research activities6- It@is understood that the  invibs-
    2           tigator shall -4ubmit receipts, --invoices,,-or-photostats thereof., of
               all reimbursements made to suppliers, contacts  or  consultants  for
               goods or services.  It-is agrko4            d the procurement  of  a
               receipt aroiiilli"Dioio@-i                    es, or prove impossible

               approval o  tT?-W"or.
                    B,  The investigator shall upon-oovletion of the program.,
               to the sponsor any, unexpended fund.1-that bad been advanced for the re--@
               search program,
                    C.  The investigator-shall open and maintain a special bank ae-
               count for receipt of all funds advanced by the 2sponsor.  In addition -
               to this, the investigator shall --- sig--n--a--DeclAfttidd@bf--Trust on the
               spopial bank account.
                    D.  Title -to permanent equipierit purchased with fulnds advanced to
               the principal investigator shall-iemain vitb-th"ponsore-Upon-co@-a-
               pletion of the program the2 sponsor-will-instruct the investigator as
               to the method and mods of dispq§41.
                    E.  It la agreed that travel expenses of the inveatigator shall
               be doetmented by travel stubs,-hotel bill and any other pertinent re-,
               calpts that are available, within the sponsor's policy  framework.
               However, it is understood Vnat travel expenses  of  suppliers-col-
         2      lectors or con--ultants stall-bd-doctL-mented only If-such a dooume.-Ita-
               tioln is an acc6pted practice and fits within the cover framevork of -
               the investigator.  kl.so, it is aareed that the arrangerrent may arise
               wherein the collector shall submit to-the-irm6stigator a fixed price,
          2     which inclides any-travel@ for a given collection  expedition.  In
               such cases, tr&,rel documentation would prove impractical from a
               security vie,@,rpoint,, hence doetimentition would not-be r,-qlaired.
                    F.  Technical reports will be sub-,utted on research progress at.-
               least semi-emlia@lly.
