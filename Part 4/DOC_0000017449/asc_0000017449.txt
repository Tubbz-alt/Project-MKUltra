                MEMORANDUM FOR: TSS/CD

                SUBJECT                 l@IKULTRA7S-Ubooj&dt@§-30 and 50
                   1. - The report of audit dated-17 June 1955 prepared by Mr.-
                       covering Project MKULTRA for the period 15 January 1954
         2               30 April 1955, recommended in connection with subproject@@--------
                30 as follows:
                       "It is suggested that-this--- oject be placed or4 a revolving
                                                  pr
                   fund basis,, i. e. , establish a fi ed aniount-of-about $500. 00
                   or any other amount-that A)ill-meet the-needs of2 the project for -
                   a rea@onable period-of t-.rt-.e-and reimburse the-fund on the basis
                   of accourtings-submitted at-least qttarterly;-@:---The --- fixed amount -
                   may be increased or decreased as-the-need demands and will
                   be recorded on the books of-the-Finance D            s an Impfest--
                   Fund.  The same certification-sho2uld be used for reimbursing the
                   imprest fund as is now-authorized by the MKULTRA plan.  Charges
                   to expense would be made only on the-basis of an accounting
                   properly approved and the accountings would remain in the
                   MKULTRA files of TSS. - This@:proposed revision -will permit more
                   accurate distribution of expenses to the proper-fiscal year and
                   will require approval2 by-operating officials-prior- to reimbursing
                   the fund for expenditures made.
                   2.  It is my understanding that cor@respondence--,vith
                Deputy Chief, Fi@nance Division@7has led to-the-conclusion  thai'aviy  i@iprest
                Fund reported on-the books of the Finance Division as such is subject to
                rules and reg-.llations which a2re not compatible with the procedures approved
                by the DCI under which MKULTRA-I@ handled.  Imprest Fund regulations
                apparently tequire tbat  expenses  and  accountings  be  forwarded  to  Finance
                Division when reimbursemert is requested.  The security maintained for
                M-KULTR.A is such that it is noll@ feasible to forward to the Finance  Division
                a list of items purchased under this pro3ject since the nature  of  these  items
                and the reasons for their purchase  (particularly  the  occasional  destruction
                of what would normally be considered unexpend.able equipment) would dis-
                close too much of the nature of the sensitive work being handled under
                MKULTRA.

                    3.  For this reason I believe it will be satisfactory to     continue with
                -subproject 30 and c.:)nvert it to an Imprest Fund rather than terminate
                   it and establish a new subproject 50 as an Imprest Fund.  This will re-
                   sult in our follo-,Ning all of the recommendations in Mr.               report
                   with the sole exception that subproject 30 -,vill not be re2corde -o-@n-the-----
                   books of the Finance Division as an Tmpre--t Fund.-
                    4.  1 understand that Maj( i' "              A
                                                 ) @ #I 0     as recently r.eturned with a complete

                   detailed list of recent expenditures un6@@@@Vti"ject. 2 It is my sug-
                   gestion  that  these  evidences  of  expenditures  be  placed  in  your  files  and-
                   that you determine the exact cash on hand.  With this figure in mind, I
                   suggest that you obligate                                         requiredwhich,
                                             -under-subproject 30 the exact sum
                   when added to the cash on  hand,-will-bring  your  total  cash  funds  to  $1, 2 000.
                   One  thousand  dollars  is  -the-sum  .vhich-I  believe  you  have  determined  to--
                   be necessary under this project rather than the amount of $500. 00 mentioned
                   as-an example by Mr.4,giaoblit
                                                        A
                     5.  When this additional obligation is on hand and you have exactly $1, 000
                   in cash,'you should operate t'Aie project as  an  Impres.t  Pund,  i.  e.  ,  future
                   reimbursements should be made at least quarterly- a       ,nd in an amount -exactly
                   equal to the new accumulation of -vouche   -"t@@-w      -'@ll thus re
                                                              -rs                      sult in  in  the
                  2 project's funds being brought ba:ck to precisely                   time it is
                                                                       -$l, 000 each
                   replenished.  Car@@7should-be-taken--to--replenish  the  fund  and-bring,  -it  back
                   to $1, 000 toward the end of -each Fiscal Year-so that expenses incurred duriig
                   a particular Fiscal Year will be covered b2y that V@Y's funds.  As mentioned
                   in Mr. p4ilipW report, charges to expense would thus be made only on the
                   basis of an accounting prb@i@ly7&pg;@@--and-the accountings would remain
                   in the MKULTRA files of TSS@@@lf your quarterly accountings coincide with
                   the end oil a Fiscal Year,-l believe that tb,.s will also sactisfy Mr  2        40PAW in
                   that reimbursements will-be- made to the project with FY funds corre-,ponding
                   to the FY in which the expenses were incurred; and         of course, approval of
                   operating  off;.cials  will  have  been  obtained  prior  to  reimbursement  to  the
                   project for these expenditures.
                      6.  You  might  discuss  this  with  Mr.  IloWthe  next  time  he  is2   in   your
                   office.  Steps should also be taken if necessary to cancel subproject 50 and
                                                  r .,=Osseo
                   the sum of $500. 00 which M . ilpm may shdw-dn his books as obligated.
