              Unit ,)hich will house 80--schizopbroriics (present census 45 patients).

                    Th2e laboratory is still undergoing minor construction, but material
               progress has been made in the past year. - The section for animal screening
               and conditioning is complete.  The sections for       animal neuropliaripacology
               and clinical pharmacology have been constructed       anti  put  into  operation,
               andan electronic workshop has been set up.  All       these 9units are actively
               at work in human and animal experiments as outlined below.  The f,@,oilities

             pharnacologist.     Two engineers  have  been  employed  for  design  and  2con-
             struclion of new    equipment and six lab assistants are-now fully trained

              one session at  the-  N6w  Jiersey-S-tate,Prison@in-'Erenton.  1,Cck-@nissioner  Bra,,nberg  has
              given his peu-.,iission.  .
                    Under D we nc,%4 have perfected and  plan  to  use  at  the  Na-.4  Jersey  Labor-itory  a
              quantitative integrator for drug studies in both man and anirials.
                    Adult unanesthetized, trained animals are used.         Under  anesthesia  small   go
              plated wood scre%-is are used as dural electrodes.       TKe,@e   lightly   engaged    2in    the
              calvariln and held firaly in place with nathacrylate with the permanent lead
              attached.   The  recording  leads  are  bi-@@polar  from  the  left  and  right   frontoparietal
              lobes of  the  brain.  The  animals  are  in  a  sound  attenuating  box  and  sit  quietly  for
              the entire I to 2 hour session after a-few training periods.---            -           -
     2               A Crohoc3ci integrator is attached to one lead.        This device rectifies the brain
              waves and by a chopping process, counts the area under the rectified curve.  A
              signal is nade at a pre-set degree of- sensi-tivity.       The nu.-tibcr  of  signals  per  unit
              tin.e is a n-easure -of the degree of cli@6trical activit2y or .1'electroG6hesis.11  The
              -number of  pulses  or  signals  is  directly-correlatable-%.iith  the  area  under  the  curve*
              The  constancy  of  the  el6tteojehesit  with  elapsed  time  can  be  calculated  and   treated
              by  the  usual  statistical  methods.-  In  this  type  of-analysis,  periods  as  long  as
              five  minutes  can  be  u2sed  as  a  baseline  or  control  aQd  thus  transient  artefacts  are
              eliminated.  The  action  of  drugs  is  usually  measured  at  1-5   minute   intervals   after
              intravenous injection and the drug action is expressed as change in percentage
              electrogenesis  frorn  the  control  preinjection  period.  Arousal  or   stlinulant   drug
              effects are  recorded  as  a  decrease  while  sleep  (sine  %.iaves)  produce  an  increase  in
              clectrogenesis.
                    E.  Annual  conference  on  neurobiolo9y  of   psychoses.   liost   previous   conferences
              of this type h,:ive been poorly planned, and the group has been too large and un@eieldy;
              V.onty spent on verbatifi recording and publishing is viost6d, and this-process further
        2      inhibits the participants.                                     -. record  will  be  in  the   form
                    The participants will be limited to 12 or 15         The

              The su-,u-,.arizing secretary will chance with each three-hour session.        In   a    two-day
              conference we2 v:ould have five sessions of three hours each.

                in that t-he onset of symptoms is delayed but in2 the     individual subjects the visual
               hallucinations are more    f,requent.  A double blind test of rigid design will bt

                tested   in animals to ascertain the possible similarity to acetylcholine.  Other
