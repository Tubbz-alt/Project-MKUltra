                  response of the adrenal gland to chronic ciivironmerital stress.  Such a
                  conception seems-to be consistent   with a.fai.r body of hitherto unrelated
                  literature, and with some very limited direct observation.
                       In any consideration of this a,rea,tlie question of anxiety and its
                  rienslirempnt is bound to corne up. - Within  the  Wechsler,  a  relative  deficit
                  in Object Assert'c-ly-,perfoi-kiance is regarded as betraying a degree of anxiety.
                  (Digit Span is al.so sor.,ietinics-sal.d to measure anxiety, but we would prefer,
                  in keeping with the  above,  to  put  it  that  Digit  Span  says  something  very
                  fu2ndamental v.-t)out how anxiety may be expressed.)  Since ottr   ,first     factor
