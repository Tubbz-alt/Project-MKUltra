           Soviet and Japanese tlhaling
               The Soviet Un-on and Japan, the    two  largest  whaling   nations,
           captured over 25,000 w'iiales during the 1975-76 season, or about 85%
           of the total  harvested.  Using  floating  factory  ships  attended  by
           catcher vessels and spotter  aircraft,  their  fleets  can  pursue  whales
           around the world.
      2          The JSSR's whaling fleet ranks first in the world in size and
           consists ef four  mother  ships  and  approximately  90  catcher  boats
           totaling about 175,000 GRT.  It operates in the Antarctic Ocean
           and in the  Pacific  Ocean  near  the  Aleutian,  Kurile  and  Comander
           Islands. The  Japanese  fleet,  although  the  second  largest  in  the
           world, is only aboit half the size of the Soviet fleet, consisting
           of three 2ioother ships and about 45 catcher vessels totaling close
           to 90,000 GRT.   It too operates  mostly  in  the  Antarctic  and  Pacific
           Oceans, although coastal  whaling  off  of  Japan  is  also  prominent.
                We have no detailed  information  on  the  current  location  of  the
           Soviet and Japanese whaling fleets -dn the Pacific.  Soviet whaling
           operations in the Pacific Ocean -- which generally consist of two
           ,,2pother ships and around 20 catcher boats -- have. however, been
           traditionally concentrated in the area between Guam, the Aleutian
                                   ds between 1
           and thti liawaiian islan              flay and 31 July.   In  August,  the
           Pacific operations follow the migratory patterns of whales along the
           US west coast and Alaska.  Soviet whaling in the Pacific normally
           ends in September or October, when the fleet returns t0o Soviet ports
           and is readied  for  Antarctic  operations  between  October  and  May.
                Japanese whaling  operations  are  generally  in  the  same  areas  of
           the Pacific, although its fleet is centered closer to Japan.  Cur-
           rently, there are an estimated 10 Japanese whaling vessels operating
           in the North Pacific, including one and possibly two mother ships.

        Honorable Leo J. Ryan
        House of Representatives                                 OCT 1978
        Washington, D.C. 2-0515
        Dear Mr. Ryan:
           . Thank you for your letter of 27 September to Admiral Turner
        requesting confirmation or denial of t2he fact of CIA experiments using
        prisoners at the California medical facility at Vacaville.
            it is true that CIA sponsored testing. using volunteer inmates,
        was conducted at that facility. The project was completed in 1968.
        A report setting forlh the details of that testing has been released
        to the authorities at Vacaville and to the public. It is enclosed for
        your information and review. Also enclosed is correspondence between
        2our Office of General Counsel and T. L. Clanon, M.D., Superintendent
        of the facility. We have also included correspondence from our Inform-
        ation and Privacy Coordinator to l@Ir. Thomas K. Dalglish, Chairperson,
        Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects, California Department
        of Health. These documents, all of which are now in the public domain,
        will give you a clearer idea of the naturp and extent of the testing,
        which2 related to learning enhancement using a well-known non-halluci-
        inogen, magnesium pemoline.
             Your letter referred to Donald DeFreese, known as CINQTJE, and
        Clifford Jefferson, both of whom were inmates at Vacaville. In so far
        as our records reflect the names of the participants, there is nothing
        to indicate that eithe@r was in any way involved in the project.  You may
        wisl,i to contact the authorities at Vac2aville for further irforrnation.
             I trust you will find this information helpful. 1PIeLz-e call rne if
        you have any questions or wisn additional iaormation.
                                                   Sincerely,
                                                   C'n@, C.
