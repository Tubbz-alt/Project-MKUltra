                           is that if a technique were devised to induce brain concussion
                           without givina_ either advance wa-rnina or causing external physical
                           trauma, the person upon recovei-y would be unable to recall what

                           design reqiisites that are apparent at-this tire:
                                       a.  The impact should be dolivered'withoiit
                       2                    advance warning.
                                       b.  The area of impact ani force distribution
                                           should be such that surface tra-an-a does
                                           not occur.

                                           its duration should be such as to obtain
             2                              the desired effect.
                                       d.  The device should be as small and as silent
                                           as possible.

                         cavitation directly without impact.  There is considerable evidence
                         that resonance cavitation can be indiaced directly in the following
                         Ways:
                                    a. A blast wave propagated in air. (Blast Concussion)
                                    b. ihysical excitation with a mechanical driver

                         considerable evidence (Cai-ver & Dinsley),that modification of the
                         pressure wave can produce profound effect--.
                      10.8 Excitation of the resonance cavitation by usino. a tuned dr-Lver
                         at -this tirie appears to be well within the relm of possibility.
                         The neurotic-lik-- FLanifestations noriiially associated with blast
            2             concussion could possibly be induced by this niethod.  Use of
                         this me-thod,@ioAever, would require actual Vn.vsical contact with
                         the drivers.
                      10.9 Excitation of the resonance cavitation by tuned sound waves also
                         appears to be a reasonable possibility.  Concentration of the sotirid-
        2                 field at some remote point could be effected with accou3tical lenses
                         and reflectors.  The blast duration would be in the oi@der of a
                         tenth of a second.  1','Asking of a noise of this duration should not
                         be too dificult.
                      11.0 It would possibly be advantageous t2o establish the effectivness
                         of both of the above methods as a tool. in brain-wash therapy.
                         A full knoiiled-e of the method and the resulti@ng sequela should be
                         of aid to arq person forced to subrait -to such treatment.
                      12.0 Possibly tl,,e most significant potential aspect of this study would
                         be in the de2velol)Lr@ent of practical ireans of aiving a person irm@.-iunity,
