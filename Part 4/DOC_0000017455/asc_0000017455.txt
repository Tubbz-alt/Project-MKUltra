                                           PROPOSAL
                 We are desirous of continuing our research activities on measures
              aimed at permitting conntxmption of larger amounts -of ethanol without
              an increase in overall nervous system depression. -Our research to
            --date (see technical reports) has brought us to a better understanding
              of the intermediary metabolierii of etha2nol.  As previously reported,
              it appears that the limiting factor-in tiie-rate of disappearance of ethanol
              from the body is due to the 'relative rat* of conversion of ethanol to
              acetaldehyde. - Any measures that can -incr6ase- the rate of this reaction
              would certai-.,-ly reduce the overall effects of ethanol-upon the nervou's
              system. -                                    2                                       -@;f
                 Currently, we have established a- coordinated clinical program of
              invegtipatioti with human volunteer subjects in the,
                                 'ed
                       and affilial.
              This, of course, would o-pon 'up many new vistas-and avenues-of approach
              and investigation.
                   Therefore, it is our proposal-to-continue to conduct our -research
              activities as foli',ows:
                   The continuing program-of work.                  ill be biologi-
              call.y and enzymologically. oriented to-determine the steps involved in
              the intermediary m,,-tabolism of alcohol.
                                                                         14

              ethanol I.C  in fat fractions will be rnade to determine whether-the
              pathway of ettianol metabolism enters-the acetate stage.
                   B.  In view of the fact that large doses of ethanol will inhibit-----
              methanol met,@bolism, attempts will al-s--O--b-e-made to compare the path--2-
              ways of methanol vs. ethanol metabolism.  The influence and effects of
              catalase, botti in vivo and in vitro, upon metllianol and/or ethanol metabo-.
              lism will be itive3tigated.
                   C.  The role of alcohol dehydrogenase in reducing glyceral-
              dehyde to glycerol and its relationship to the- effects of fructose in in- -
              creasing the rate of ethanol me0tabolism will also be !nvestigated.  The -
              iniplications in this specific instance hold-great promise towards devising'
              an antagonist ctgainat the depressant effects of ethanol.

                         Research on AjitaWnists to the Depressant Effect of Ethyl Alcohol
                             As an informal interim progress report,  the  followlnc.,  research  for  this
                     year has been complete2d and is in preparation for publication.
                                The prominence attributed to the use of tri-iod-D@thyronine as an agent
                             for rapid "soberip-g up"- has- not -bee-ii-substaii-ti-ated in our laboratories.
                             'Flie dosa,(,re@Tof tri-iodotliyroiiine used exl)crinientall-@ in our dog2s were,
                             astrt-viion.i.ical in relation to the usual therapeutic dose in man. Amazili, y,
                             the (logs tolerated the hi,,Yh dosage quite well and manifested  only  a  rise
                             in body temperature and ircreased p,@Lntii-ig. The effect of tri-iodotliyronine
                             on the rat2e of alcohol oxidation was neglegilile and certainly not, more than
                             that noA-Mally catised by tl,.e increase in body temperature.
                             2. Pyridoxine
                                 TIv effectiveness of pyridoxine or vitiniin B6 is essentially the same
                             as that of tri-iodotbyronine. It is difficult to accotl2-it for the  reputation
                             recently gained by both pyrilloxine and tri-ioeotliyroiiine in ttie press witli-
                             out the support of critical ex-perimeiitat data.
                                 Perhaps this can be accounted for by the fact that the effect of a rib-i-lig
                             concerltration of alcohol in the Liloofd c!oes not have a linear  relationship
                             to nervous system depression, bLt rather a lo-arilhmic one. Therefore,
                             there is a critical concentration below which the  iticlividti,-d  may  appear

                            seemed to  be the first step in oxid2ation, the conversion of alcohol to acetalde-
                            hy(le. Since the necessary coenzyme of the enzyme mediating this step is
                            diphosphopyridiiie riticleotide, or DPN,--tlid-first experiments were designed
                            to determine whether the coenzyme is deficient in tl--e livers of fasting animals.
         2                   Our exl)eriiiiental measurements shonve-d that DPN W    as not deficient in tii-c livers
                            of fasting aiiinials.
                                Attent:io.i.i was next directed to the enzyme itself,  al'cohol deliydrogenase.
                            Livers were assayed for total content of glcoliol deliy(Trogeiia2se and it was
                            determined that fat3titig aitimals had a higher concentration of the enzyme.
                                Sin-te the equilibrium constant for alcohol dehyd-toa,-enaqe is far to the
                            left in favor of alcohol, it would appeir that if the concentration of acetalde-
      2                      I-,,yde rises, the rate of alcoh(.)l oxidation would I)c slowed. ThL@refore, seiiii-

                            did not change tl-io relationship. Thus it-would seem that the accumulation of
                            acetalde4yde did not iiiflueitce the rate of alcohol metaL)ol.isiii.

                                            PROPOSAL
                       To determine whether or not tranquilizers exert a synergistic
           --------and/or supplexi-iciital action upon the usual rate and degree of alcohol
                  intoxication.
                                          INTRODUCTION
                       The present day definitions of anxiety and stress remain in
                  dis2t3ute.---However, anxiety can be considered essentially a human
                  function because it is associated with the cal@tacity for delayed re-
                  action, setf reflection of motivation and the capacity for projection
                  of the individual into the future. The concept of stres@!i'@-e'volves
                  around the arousal of anxieties. In general, anxiety may be aroused
                -by any conditio2n which threatens the integrity of the organism.
                  Therefor e. any stiiyiullis nity, in principle, -arouse an dnxiety res -
                  ponse because of the particular i-iieaniiig of threat it may have for
                  that particular individual. Ho%vever, we can distinguish a class
                  of stii-riuli which will invariably produce disturbarces in-rnost in-
                  dividual2s. The term "stress" can be-applied to this class of
                  conditions.
                       Acute stresses and anxieties with in our social patterns of -
                  behavior necessitates the use of tranquilizers on the part of many
                  persons to adequately meet and cope with these problems. Often
                  titi-ies people will partake-of-",%-few tranquilizers" prior to going-----
                  o2ut for an evenin--of-social-drinki-ig and partying-. Ilow does the
                  combination of tranquilizers and alcohol affect the motor skills,
                  sensory processes and ciritical judgements which are not normally
                  affected by either tranquilizers-or-alcohol taken separately?
                       Therefore.- the following coiirse -of investigation is proposed:--
                           To2 determine whether or not tranquilizers exert a syn-
                           ergistic and/or- s-,ii.)plexllental action upon the usual rate
                           degree of alcohol intoxication.
                              1. Desitn and test methods involving clinical subjects
                                 which will-descrit-iiinate betnveen norn-iill tranquilizedi-

                                 particular and spcc-i,fic-states-or effects which can

                                 Iiiii-riaiis and relate them to alterations in 1-nood and
                                 behavior in as objective a fashion as possible.
                       The above rnethodolooy will involve the use of a Nystagixiograph,
                  electroencephalograph (Lead 11), Breathalyzer, Polygraph, and
